The purpose of this community is to equip students with tools and information they can use as they discover what non-profit field they have a passion for. We will focus on international, national, and local non-profits and examine the different ways that they are run. We will have representatives from non-profits come in and discuss with us what their organization does, how it was started, and give us a need that we can fundraise for. By fundraising for these sound organizations, it will not only help their organization, but it will also give our members hands-on fundraising experience (which is something that every non-profit will need to know how to do) and teach them how to explain a cause to the public. Besides speakers, we will also have \"brainstorming\" meetings, where we discuss with one another what our individual passions are, where those passions come from, common mistakes done by non-profits, the mind set behind effective non-profit organizations, and tools that the students can be utilizing while they are in college to takeÂ the first steps towards their future organization.Â As a community, our goal is to become influential humanitarian leaders of today and tomorrow.",

We propose to be an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students at Texas A&M University.\n\nOur student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives:\n\n1) Advocacy\n\nMany Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the challenges of the university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, the IGA proposes to work with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community.\n\n2) Networking\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA plans to offer a platform for students to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging.\n\n3) Mentoring\n\nA serious lack of mentorship at a departmental level for our graduate students has been observed. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGA plans to have departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of such mentorship will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.",

Since 1949, Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. has expanded across the United States, holding multiple chapters in California and Texas. Our vision as a sorority is to promote sisterhood. We hold many sisterhood events throughout the year to promote such values as: unity, friendship and teamwork. Our mission is to help young women adjust to college life by creating a sisterhood that promotes Asian awareness. The sisters of Sigma Phi Omega are strongly committed to serving the community, as well. Our official National Philanthropy is domestic violence. In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our organization hosts a week of anti-domestic violence activities. However, this does not limit us to just one cause, our mission is much wider with a variety of other community service projects. Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. intends to uphold it's foundation, while infusing it with the Aggie Spirit.",

The Club offers many activities and events oriented toward automobiles.Â \n\nThe Club was founded in 1968 and is one the the few university sponsored sports car clubs in the nation. It is also the largest collegiate car club in the nation.Â \n\nThe club organizes a variety of events from Autocrosses, Rallyes, Drag Races to Car Shows and social events like weekly dinners, get-togethers, and meetings. The club is also a good place to get help in car projects and repairs as many of the club members have years of experience and valuable knowledge they'll gladly share.\n\nClub memberships give discounts at the club's events and discounts from the club's sponsors as well. Talk to the secretary for more details about memberships.\n\nDespite the name \"sports car club\" having a sports car is not necessary to partake in the club's events. Participants don't even have to have cars either. All that is needed is an interest in automobiles and a little sense of adventure.\n\nTAMSCC: \"Where driving is graded on a curve.\"",

The Public Health team collaborates with school teachers and other key community members to develop a curriculum that will directly address the communitiesâ needs, while volunteers prepare lessons for the children during each brigade. We recruit students from all over campus with no particular prior experience needed. Each of the communities served receives a brigade every 3 to 4 months with hopes of creating self sustaining communities by preventing disease. Between brigades, the in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up to ensure all projects and education were successful.",

Since then, we have been facilitating collaborations and communications among Taiwanese as well as connecting Taiwan and the U.S.\n\nThrough TTBA, we seek to unite Taiwanese in biology-related fields, including students, postdoctoral fellows, and young professionals in both academia and industry in Texas. We then are not only able to voice for ourselves, build new connections, share scientific breakthroughs, but also discuss job information and exchange career advice. In addition, current leaders in the field are able to network and cooperate with each other, and at the same time pass down practical knowledge to the young generation. We hope that by bridging the gap between academia and industry, we are able to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and contribute to the enterpriseâs development.",
