We also strive to develop students' career interests in healthcare by offering students the opportunity to interact with nephrologists and other healthcare providers, build leadership skills, and give back to the community. Texas has a higher chronic kidney disease rate than the national average, and we hope to help change this unfortunate reality one step, one screening, and one educational event at a time.",

Science is fostered through the training of citizen scientists and the collection of water samples on each trip. Service is achieved through outreach activities in which members use their river skills and resources for the benefit of the Austin community. Environmental Leadership is developed through outreach initiatives that draw community attention to issues of water conservation and watershed protection. River Readiness is built over time through paddling and swift water rescue trainings, gear, trip planning, safety instruction and trip execution. The LST believes in experiental education and seeks to make river health and water quality part of the conversation at the University of Texas and the surrounding community.",

The phrase \"Nritya Sangam\" means \"unity of dance,\" which is exemplary of the type of students selected to join Nritya Sangam; our members represent a diverse array of schools and styles of Indian dance. In addition, each member  is an experienced dancer, carrying years of extensive training under the instruction of their respective teachers. We dance to keep up with an art form and talent we have spent so many years cultivating, and to preserve our age-old culture and traditions. \n\nThe ancient Indian dance styles that we primarily derive inspiration from are Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi, art forms that are struggling to survive in modern society. We hope to expose the mainstream community to the richness and depth of an art little-known in America through performances on the UT campus, as well as around Austin and other parts of the state and nation. The members of Nritya Sangam serve as ambassadors of traditional Indian fine arts on-campus, as the troupe is the only Indian classical dance group at the university. \n\nNritya Sangam strives to make its community a better place. You can help us by officially recognizing and acknowledging the work that we do in the city of Austin and internationally. Your continued support affirms our drive to attain our goals. Please spread the word and help us publicize our causes and mission as we gain momentum as an organization.",

The club reaches out to local elementary schools and visits several times during the semester to give an interactive presentation to the kids, which is split into two parts- public health and dental. Each presentation is designed for specific age groups.\n\nThe story behind our mission is many children develop habits at an early age that carry onto adulthood. Bad habits are hard to break later on as people are so accustomed to their habits. This is why our goal is to educate children on habits such as washing your hands, brushing your teeth twice a day, and staying hydrated. We want to teach children small, every day habits they can incorporate into their lives and take an interest in. Therefore, the children can develop healthy living habits that they will keep as they grow older! \n\nThe great thing about Texas Healthy Habits is that you can earn community service hours while volunteering alongside with other members. Many college students are in search of community service hours, so why not volunteer together with your friends and meet new ones!",

The main objective of the group is to facilitate the development of leadership skills for women in all undergraduate engineering majors while attracting and retaining more women in engineering by making group activities fun, exciting, and ultimately valuable in achieving long-range career goals. Each year we focus on a different hands-on project. In the past, we have launched a payload into space, sent a balloon into the upper atmosphere, flown on NASA’s “Vomit Comet,” and modified a drone to carry a glider which autonomously navigates to pre-determined waypoints.
