    "fullDescription": "Aikido is a self defense martial art emphasizing the continuous connection between the persons practicing a technique. The attacked party (nage) controls the attacker (uke) by redirecting their energy and intent, rather than clashing with them head-on, thus resolving the conflict in a energy-efficient way. We practice open-hand technique (throws, locks, pins), as well as weapons -- wooden sword (bokken), knife (tanto), and staff (jo). Aikido is a non-competitive martial art. We usually practice techniques with a partner, with each party taking turns to do and receive the technique. Testing and promotion are achieved through the demonstration of various techniques appropriate to the level of the practitioner. We always welcome beginners! If you are interested in learning more about Aikido, you are welcome to come to one of our practice sessions to observe a class, talk to the members of the club, or try doing some techniques yourself! Make sure you wear loose clothes such as sweat pants and a t-shirt if you don't have an Aikido uniform. Practice is open to IU students/faculty/staff and to the public. All backgrounds and experience levels are welcome! Meeting times and locations are: Mondays and Wednesday: 7:30pm - 9:00pm, WIC 095 Saturday: 10:00am - 11:30am, WIC 095 In addition, IU offers a 1 credit Aikido class, HPER 153.

    "fullDescription": "Alpha Delta Pi holds the distinction of being the first secret society in the world for college women. Alpha Delta Pi is proud to have over 140 collegiate chapters throughout the United States and Canada. We provide life skills like leadership development through holding chapter offices, encouragement and assistance to foster scholastic achievement and stress the importance of higher education, opportunities to serve our communities through philanthropic events, and lasting, lifelong friendships. Our Total Membership Education program offers our members timely, relevant programming to help develop well-rounded women. Membership in Alpha Delta Pi is not just for four years. It's for a lifetime. Mission statement Established in 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is committed to sisterhood, values and ethics, high academic standards and social responsibility. Values Scholarship Scholarship is very important to the Greek community. Alpha Delta Pi expects that each of its members will be committed to high academic standards and will exemplify that commitment through classroom attendance and performance. Chapters provide educational programs, chapter and campus resource information, and motivation and recognition programs. We are committed to a legacy of learning to help members prepare for the future and create a desire to continue learning throughout their lifetime. Leadership Greek life provides outstanding leadership opportunities. Each chapter is self-governing, thus relying on the talents of its members for its success. Members learn important lessons of leadership as members of ADPis Executive Board or as officers on a programming team. Some take the reins as leaders in their Campus Panhellenic association. Members are encouraged to take on leadership roles in campus and community organizations, as well. Service The Greek community donates considerable time and effort to helping philanthropic efforts around the world. Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Chapters organize annual events to raise money for RMHC, as well as participate in other Greek and campus service events. Philanthropy gives our members a sense of purpose and perspective, and it reinforces a lifelong commitment of giving to others.\nFriendship Its not just four years it's for a lifetime. A fundamental part of membership is the opportunity to share the bond of sisterhood through the successes and challenges of college. Within the chapter, members find support, encouragement, fun, and a connection unlike any other. Those bonds continue long after graduation as members connect and reconnect with members from coast to coast. Social A robust social experience is one of the many benefits of Greek life. Chapters participate in campus Homecoming and Greek Week events; host formals, date parties, and mixers with other Greek organizations; and host special events with alumnae and parents. Chapter leaders work hard to ensure safe and fun social events are a part of their members lives. Commitment to Philanthropy & Service The House That Love Built Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Alpha Delta Pi has contributed over $2 million to this worthwhile effort. RMHC supports Ronald McDonald Houses in local communities and funds grants to other nonprofit organizations whose programs focus on children in need. Today, 271 Ronald McDonald Houses in 30 countries and regions help keep families with seriously ill or injured children together when they need it most by offering them a comfortable, temporary residence in proximity to a medical facility. In addition to donating money to this incredible organization, collegiate chapters and alumnae associations spend their time and energy volunteering at local Ronald McDonald Houses. Alpha Delta Pi Foundation The mission of the Alpha Delta Pi Foundation, Inc. is to provide essential resources for Alpha",

    "fullDescription": "Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded to provide opportunities for the Jewish college man seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience. We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career. Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity's 94-year history, over 83,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,000 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago. Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow's Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow's Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time. Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a learning laboratory, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood. Alpha Epsilon Pi prepares young men for their role in life as responsible citizens. Therefore, our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity, though non-discriminatory and open to all who are willing to espouse its purpose and values.",

The Beta Pi chapter of Alpha Xi Delta at Indiana University is extremely proud to have achieved one of the top 5 chapter GPA's within the Panhellenic Council. During this past recruitment, Alpha Xi Delta added 60 incredible new members completing our family of 197 amazing women. These women have been working together with Autism Speaks, Inc. since 2009 toward cause research, treatment, and prevention of autism. This past April, Alpha Xi Delta held its first annual \"Step it Up 3k\", a 3k walk/run benefiting Autism Speaks, Inc. With the support of many other greek affiliations on campus and the community, an amazing $17,000 was raised for Autism Speaks in just the first year of the event. This involvement extends to campus-wide events such as Safe Halloween, EveryBODY week, Safe Sisters, The Body Project, and IUDM. Alpha Xi Delta is looking forward to this semester with all of their new members!",

    "fullDescription": "American Student Radio Mission Statement Goals: This is a station run by students, for students with input from journalism professors and acclaimed national professionals. American Student Radio is a national publication and a national classroom: A forum for learning to make useful journalism that enables a civil society. Everyone should be able to take something from our shows and online content. Educational – There are public, national arguments over what journalism is and what it should become. This is what we think journalism should be: A civic-minded pledge to represent diverse human experiences and perspectives on the events that we share as a community that. American Student Radio is a forum for this generation to learn how to achieve this and form and sustain a set of national best practices for this generation. Empowering – American Student Radio is an opportunity for students across the country to create their own professional media dialogue and form a new national journalistic network for this generation. It will connect people, but it is not social media. It is a journalistic forum for students across the country to report on and consider the important issues of the day. Diverse – Student bodies, by definition, are full of different kinds of people. Yes, we’re young, but we come from different places and have different ethnic backgrounds and families. So while we share hardships and successes as Americans, we do so from different perspectives. American Student Radio will cover our diverse perspectives on shared issues. We are reporting from across the country to a nation. Ethical - It is our charge to set a civic tone, to create useful journalism. Members and contributors will work to anticipate all relevant sides of a national issue and report them fully and in context. We will also report our own journalistic process as we produce our work and invite discussion towards clarifying and establishing a national conversation about the responsibility of, and civic necessity for, ethical journalism. Innovative – We are the first of our kind. We are carving out a national forum for in the new media landscape, and this forum will be shaped by our imaginations. While we will practice the journalistic values and practices of fairness, research and civic responsibility, we will also challenge traditional definitions of ‘what is a story,’ ‘what is newsworthy’ and ‘what is useful to our community’ - with the insights of each unique generation of students that work through this station. Entertaining – This includes enlightenment, challenging our listeners, but also making our products worth listening to. Each show should include an element of originality and surprise. (Lovely.) Ethical Guidelines (I think these go in our packets for our staff and for contributors who want to file… and for our other various sundry partners as an FYI, but it should be separate from the mission. On the website, but in a different place…) Seek the truth and report it – Be honest, fair and open in our opinions – not inflammatory. Seek the best expert, not just the one we know personally or agree with. Do not stereotype. Report all relevant sides. Do no harm – Make a concerted effort to be positive, do not be purposefully combative for the sake of being combative. Do good. Be compassionate. We are not a tabloid. Act Independently – This needs to be created FOR students BY students – stay free from conflicts of association, or fully disclose them. Hold sources/subjects accountable – don’t be afraid of this because we’re young. Be Accountable – We are students AND professionals. We owe it to our listeners to report stories accurately and swiftly correct ourselves if we are wrong. Our listeners, then, have every right to pellet us with t",

    "fullDescription": "On October 1, 1999, twelve students founded the Baltic and Finnish Studies Association (BaFSA). The organization was duly registered with Indiana University on October 4 and since that date its membership has grown quickly. IU has been a longtime supporter of Baltic and Finnish studies. Eminent scholars such as Felix Oinas, Janis Penikis, Toivo Raun, and Inta Carpenter have served or continue to serve as IU faculty members. Recently, IU hosted both the 16th conference of the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies and the Baltic Studies Summer Institute. IU also regularly offers three levels of both Finnish and Estonian. BaFSA is an outgrowth of this commitment and corresponding student interest. BaFSA aims to support and promote a multidisciplinary community of scholarly inquiry into Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian society, history, culture, and language. In pursuit of this goal, BaFSA sponsors academic and cultural events. The association also acts as a link to other organizations and institutions engaged in like-minded activities. Special emphasis is put on encouraging interest among those still unacquainted with Baltic and Finnish studies. Membership is open to all interested persons wishing to participate in the association and the general public and undergraduates are strongly encouraged to attend its activities. BaFSA is affiliated with both the department of Central Eurasian Studies (CEUS) and the Russian and East European Institute (REEI). BaFSA's faculty advisors are CEUS professor Toivo Raun and lecturer Piibi-Kai Kivik.",

This organization is designed to bring clarity and real-life stories to the many students who are unsure, worried, and naïve of actual career paths that can be taken to achieve their career goals. This organization will utilize the over 100,000 Kelley alumni by bringing in Kelley graduates with all different types of degrees, in various types of positions, who graduates anywhere from 5-40 years ago to discuss their unique career paths. This will expose members to drastically different professional tracks that lead to many different areas.",

We build this community of disciples through our celebration of the Sacraments, evangelization, faith sharing, social events, retreats, and service. Whether it be at Mass on Sunday, in small groups, on retreat, or over a plate of pasta at our weekly Sunday Suppers, every Hoosier Catholic has a place and everyone is called to become a disciple of Jesus Christ.\n \nIn the Fall of 2017, we welcomed five FOCUS missionaries to join our staff at St. Paul's. These missionaries significantly augmented our work of building, nurturing, and sending disciples at IU.\n\nWhether you are an incoming freshmen, an upperclassman making your way back to the Church, or anywhere else in your faith journey, we are here to serve you and I am here to walk this journey of faith with you. \n\nIt is the highest privilege to be your priest.

    "fullDescription": "Vision Statement\nWe are a diverse community of Christians on Indiana University campus, living out our faith in Jesus Christ, equipped to fulfill our purpose in God's global plan.\nCore Values\nThese core values represent Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship most deeply held beliefs. They serve to guide our decisions, our leadership practices, and our community life. All our organizational actions will reflect these core values. 1. Community\nCommunity is a covenantal value shaping our mission to the university, and our priority to come together for biblically commanded action. The salvation of Jesus offers the forgiveness of sins and the incorporation into the people of God. As a collegiate community we are to be salt and light showing to the world what it means to authentically love God and one's neighbor. 2. Creativity\nGod is first revealed in Scripture as a creative God. We are committed to achieving commitment that appreciates the proven with an adaptive open eye to what He has in store today and beyond. His Spirit will release to us new ways, ideas, and plans. 3. Diversity\nA diverse community reflects a reconciliation of students to Jesus across all campus demographics. Each student possesses unique gifts, and we seek to encourage their full implementation in the community. We also accept diverse methods and approaches to ministry. We celebrate these unique ministry expressions as the demonstration of what God is doing on our campuses and encourage their effective application. 4. Excellence\nStriking performance, exceptional virtue, and continuous improvement exemplify excellence. Excellence goes the second mile by doing the best possible job. It calls out of us far more than we can possibly imagine. Excellence guides how we make significant choices. It causes us to discover our true God-given capabilities. Excellence depicts our approach to leadership, work, organization, and our life together. 5. Integrity\nIntegrity describes the state of sound moral uprightness. It is characterized by honesty, truthfulness, respect, and sincerity. Integrity in its simplest biblical definition means wholeness or completeness. Integrity invites oneself into a partnership with the Holy Spirit. This fosters an atmosphere of credibility and plausibility among those to whom we minister and within our communities on campus. Integrity promotes long-term success. 6. Servant-Leadership\nServant-leadership is a practice that places the good of those led and their progressive maturity over the self-interest of the leader. It shares power and status for the sake of the common good of each individual and the community. Its chief motive is to serve-first, as opposed to lead-first. The final goal is to empower others to become servants themselves.",

Its purposes are to promote continued high academic standards, to foster increased communication among its members, and to honor academic excellence achieved by those students. The involvement of eligible alumni enables networking for members. Programs sponsored by the society encourage other students toward this accomplishment.\n\nThe honor society also has the potential to be a significant political force in the support of funding for developmental studies and educational opportunity programs nationwide.",

Focusing on elementary-aged kids, College Mentors buses the kids to campus once a week where they meet one-on-one with a mentor who, over the course of the school year, acquaints them with the campus in various activities. Each buddy pair is a part of a buddy family consisting of other little buddies and their mentors. One day a week for two hours, the buddy families participate in various activities around campus highlighting the benefits to coming to college. Past activities have included going to Assembly Hall to watch the basketball team practice, going to a chemistry lab where a professor teaches them how to make ice cream, and visiting the Indiana Daily Student where they get to make the front page of a newspaper. The experience of visiting IU each week is especially beneficial to these kids because many of them come from low-income families where neither parent has attended college.",

Collins Living-Learning Center aims to provide a small but diverse residential community that addresses the needs and interests of the student.\nOur primary goal is to create an environment in which undergraduate students can succeed academically and grow as individuals in the process of exploring academic interests and avocations that will reward, challenge, and stimulate them. The objectives by which this goal is met are as varied as the student residents.\nUndergraduates are given the opportunity to participate in the formulation of their own accredited University curriculum through Collins’ Board of Educational Programming. This student-centered curriculum, paired with an experiential learning philosophy, makes the Collins program unique in the nation.\nWe encourage students to teach as well as learn. Our active program—which includes student-planned workshops, performances, publications, book clubs, and film series—allows individuals to take the lead in their areas of interest.\nCollins offers opportunities to learn and participate in a variety of artistic media in both academic and extracurricular settings. And, residents can grow in their understanding of the greater community by opting to participate in service activities that range from tutoring of children to environmental sustainability projects.\nWe provide quiet and comfortable study areas conducive to academic progress, as well as group meeting facilities, common areas, classrooms, computer labs, a student-run coffeeshop, and a library. Our full-service dining area serves as the social heart of the community and provides for a variety of dietary needs, including vegetarian and vegan options.\nAmple opportunities for academic, artistic, and philanthropic participation—in combination with providing for physical needs—establishes a culture in which it’s possible for students to expand their intellectual and personal horizons.",

With these goals in mind, the CPSO strives to encourage a collaborative union with students and faculty in order to promote the enhancement of the student experience in the counseling psychology doctoral program. In addition to taking an active role in improving the faculty-student relationship in the counseling psychology doctoral program, the CPSO also strives to develop a sense of community within the student body. The CPSO committee is a governing body with two elected members, the president and vice president, and a variety of volunteer members. These committee members change yearly, and students from in-coming PhD cohorts are also encouraged to apply. Committee members include a president and vice president, a social chair, a diversity coordinator/chair, an international student chair, and a newsletter/blog chair. We also have a member-at-large and a master's student representative who is present at monthly meetings.",

We are especially proud of our philanthropic contributions through our Anchor Slam 3-on-3 basketball tournament to support Service for Sight, Delta Gamma's philanthropy that assists the blind and visually impaired. In 2012, we held our first annual Lectureship on Values and Ethics where we brought Jack Nicklaus to speak at the IU Auditorium, free of charge to the students and Bloomington community. In 2015, we brought Piper Kerman, author of \"Orange is the New Black\", to speak to the campus.

Hockey has been played at Indiana University since 1969, and in the past 45 years has compiled a staggering record of 541-394-50. The program grew to prominence in the 1980s under the direction of Dr. Leonard Burrello, who led the team to 4 MCHL championships in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1989. The most prominent era in IU Hockey history occurred under the direction of coach Rich Holdeman, who led the program from 1992-2006. During his tenure, Holdeman moved the program into the ACHA where he immediately made the program a national powerhouse. Holdeman led the team to 11 straight national tournaments with 4 national runner-up finishes. In 2013, coach Holdeman was elected to the ACHA Hall of Fame, making him one of just 12 members to ever receive this honor. Today, the program plays at the Division 3 level of the ACHA, and is a member of the newly formed Indiana Collegiate Hockey Conference (ICHC) which features Indiana University, Ball State University, Butler University, Miami University, Trine University, and the University of Indianapolis. The team plays roughly a 30 game schedule with the season culminating in the ICHC Conference Tournament, as well as a hopeful bid to play in the regional and national tournaments. The team has advanced to the regional tournament the past two seasons, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The team plays their home games at the Frank Southern Ice Arena in Bloomington.",

As a secular, California-based 501c3 nonprofit organization, we empower university students and young professionals nation-wide to provide communities in developing countries with sustainable solutions that improve quality of life while respecting local culture and improving the environment. At Indiana University, we plan to build a foundation of volunteers and leaders, each motivated to make a profound impact on our world. Global Medical Brigades is an international network of university clubs and volunteer organizations that travel to developing countries to perform health care in communities without access to medicine otherwise. Global Medical Brigades also works alongside Global Water Brigades, Public Health Brigades, Business Brigades, Microfinance Brigades, Environmental Brigades, and Arts Brigades to help ensure the communities we serve are provided with the services they need to further ensure their health treatment and long term sustainability. Our current emphasis is in the countries of Nicaragua and Panama. In its first year of existence in 2009-2010 Global Brigades at IU took 93 students and 7 professionals to Honduras and Panama to work on public health, medical, business, and clean water projects. Along with brigades from different parts of the country, they were able to accomplish the following: provided 16,771 patients with medical care, improved living conditions of 104 people using public health projects, provided 125 homes with access to clean water, opened 28 new savings accounts, established 32 potential borrowers, provided sustainable business structures for 50 members, provided legal stability for 50 members, and consulted 200 members on improving the efficiency and profitability of their business. These efforts have been strengthened every year since and will continue to grow in the future. Global Brigades is leading the way in sustainability in international development. With its unique holistic structure, through the many disciplined brigades, Global Brigades is able to offer lasting, sustainable solutions to communities in a way no other organization can.

This representative or these representatives may be the GSAC chair or a committee selected by the chair; (3) to send two members to attend departmental faculty meetings when invited by the department Chair; (4) to send representatives to the USAC and the University Graduate and Professional Student Organization; (5) to assist in assigning graduate students to Department committees when asked by the Department Chair; (6) to communicate with new and prospective graduate students; (7) to organize the Works-in-Progress Lecture Series; (8) to submit pertinent information to the Director of Graduate Studies; (9) to plan social activities such as the coffee hour; (10) to distribute GSAC minutes to all graduate students after each meeting; (11)to identify and acknowledge outstanding faculty members each year through the granting of the annual 'Outstanding Faculty Mentor Award; (12) to post an agenda one week before regular meetings; (13) to hold a general departmental graduate student meeting at the start of the academic year, ideally during the first week of classes; and (14) to organize the luncheon for examinees taking the Master's Exam during the fall and/or spring semester(s).",

For instance, in the past, we’ve partnered with a caricature artist to host a self-image improvement event. We’ve also worked with Middle Way House to host a Healthy Halloween Carnival to raise awareness for obesity. Currently, we are excited to continue our volunteering with LIFEDesigns to boost the physical activity of their clients with disabilities. Our members truly do create a real impact in the community. As Dhara, a current member stated, “HealthNOW has pushed me to view health more holistically and engage with the community in meaningful ways such as working with LIFEDesigns to improve their clients' physical activity.” Our focus for the year 2017-2018 is to generate innovative events and volunteer opportunities which will empower individuals to make an impact in issues related to abortion, blood supply, the refugee crisis, and more!",

This organization is open to all students currently enrolled in the graduate history program at Indiana University. The HGSA is dedicated to serving the needs of history graduate students and fostering community within the history department by sponsoring professional, educational and social programs for both graduate students and for the department as a whole. HGSA also provides a strong voice of advocacy for its members in both departmental and university affairs. In furtherance of these goals, HGSA sponsors a number of annual events and ongoing programs, as well as special events and student initiatives. Annual events and ongoing programs include new student orientation; a brown bag lecture series; the annual HGSA Conference; a fall pizza party and the Winter Soiree (the two biggest events of the department social calendar); and publication of the HGSA newsletter and Web site. In addition to its regular programs, the HGSA organizes occasional special events in connection with faculty searches, visiting scholars, and professional conferences. HGSA also encourages members to initiate their own programs and activities as needed. In recent years, student initiatives have produced a series of funding talks and professional development workshops with faculty representatives, a variety of reading and discussion groups and numerous happy hours and other social occasions. We have also undertaken two consecutive comprehensive surveys of our members in order to begin and maintain a dialogue with the department on the state of graduate education at IU.",

The vision behind the Journal is for it to serve as an interdisciplinary, academic forum for scholars, practitioners, policymakers, and students to contribute to society’s understanding of legal and policy issues concerning race, religion, gender, and class. The Journal aims to become a major effort in leading scholars and practitioners to improve race, religion, gender, and class relations, foster new research in and across the disciplines, and provide the intellectual foundation for the pursuit of social equality. By drawing on leading Indiana University scholars from a variety of departments and programs, the Journal seeks to transform the lens through which issues of race, religion, gender, and class are viewed by identifying new issues and offering new theoretical and pedagogical approaches. In doing so, the Journal will not only improve the discourse on race, religion, gender, and class, but also change the nature of analysis to legal and social issues concerning historically marginalized groups.",

    "fullDescription": "Indiana University Dance Marathon (IUDM) is a student organization that raises funds and awareness for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. In 1991, IUDM was established by IU alumnus Jill Stewart shortly after her good friend Ryan White passed away from AIDS. Ryan was a hemophiliac at birth that contracted HIV through an infected blood transfusion. At the time of his diagnosis of HIV, very little was known about the disease and the associated stigma was stronger than ever. Ryan didn't want any of the children to have to experience the negative effects of the stigma, so he traveled the country speaking at various events, high schools, and even went in front of the President's Commission on AIDS. IUDM strives to instill the type of passion and dedication that Ryan had by raising funds and awareness for Riley Hospital. After fulfilling our endowment for the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center (RWIDC) at Riley Hospital, we began dedicated our funds to the Wells Center for Pediatric Research. IUDM is split up into 18 committees that work year-round to raise money, plan events, and prepare for our culminating event called the Dance Marathon. The Dance Marathon is a 36-hour event that consists of over 4,000 IU students (called Dancers) that stand on their feet in honor of Ryan White and the children being treated at Riley Hospital for Children. At the event there are various games, bands, Riley family speakers, IU faculty speakers, meals, snacks, and much, much more. At the end of the 36 hours, the total amount raised for Riley Hospital for that year is revealed. In 2018, IUDM raised over $4.1 million and in all IUDM has raised over $36 million for the kids at Riley Hospital. This year's Dance Marathon will take place in the IU Indoor Tennis Center on November 15th - November 17. Please check out www.iudm.org/register to join our IUDM family.",

The ACHA is a nationally recognized organization made up of club level ice hockey teams from all over the United States.

Indiana University Ice Hockey has been in existence since 1968, but was not very prominent on the IU campus or Indiana in general until Dr. Leonard Burrello became their Faculty Advisor and General Manager. During the 1980s and 90s IU played in the now extinct MCHL and won 6 championships. In 1992 Dr. Rich Holdeman became head coach and led the Hoosiers to be the top Division II team in the nation and to a record 16 straight trips to the National Championships. Al Karlander, a former NHL and WHA player, coached the team in 2006 and 2007 and helped the team to a second place finish at the 2008 National Championship.  All of Indiana's games are played at the historic Frank Southern Center Ice Arena on the south side of Bloomington. Indiana University has one Ice Hockey team: - ACHA Division II Ice Hockey team. Plays in the Tri-State Collegiate Hockey League (TSCHL) from September to March.",

Through this festival, we wish to create a bridge to engender dialogue and collaboration between practitioners, students, scholars, and members of the Bloomington community who share an investment in human rights struggles occurring around the world. By engaging professors and students from a wide range of disciplines in the planning and implementation of the festival, we are focused on creating a professional team with experience in film studies, film production, and festival organizing. ILFF focus is international in scope, presenting films made both domestically and abroad. We are committed to bringing filmmakers with a diverse array of voices and perspectives to campus in order to enrich the quality of the discourse surrounding human rights at IU and in Bloomington. Furthermore, the festival aims at creating valuable resources for students interested in documentary filmmaking, human rights activism, and those who are interested in working with human rights documentaries as part of their scholarly projects.",

Also, the knowledge and leanings that students gain in their classes are solely related to their majors. This in return limits their knowledge therefore, making the student not be aware of the events happening in the world. This is why I came up with the idea of focusing the current events and trends that is happening in the world. This way it gives the members of the club a worldly view of what is happening around the world and see what events and patterns are the new style or trend in the world. The club is focusing on the new trend of the world because this can gives members the opportunity to learn the things that are not taught in classes.

In addition to publishing conventional articles, IP Theory serves as a forum for essays, opinion pieces, and literature reviews, of which are more concise than typical law review articles. As such, IP Theory is free from many constraints of traditional law journals and provides authors with a variety of formats to commentate, present research, and inform the IP community about developments in the law and legal practice.\n\nFaculty members and the student board solicit and select content. Student editors further manage logistics and editing, enabling a fast turnover of manuscripts. Articles are published on a rolling basis as soon as the review process is complete. For more information, please contact Prof. Mark Janis, CIPR's director, or Prof. Michael Mattioli, the journal's faculty advisor.",

The club was founded in Fall 1998 and became a Recreational Sport in the fall of 2001.

We generally concentrate on Savoy-style Lindy Hop, Charleston, and St. Louis Shag. However, we have also dabbled in other dance styles, including the Collegiate Shag, Balboa, and more! The Swing Club tends to favor historical dance styles, but we also mix it up with more modern music and dance. The Club offers weekly lesson series for both beginners and intermediate dancers each semester, as well as social dance opportunities and other events.",

    "fullDescription": "Calamity Jane Ultimate is rooted in respect, teamwork, and love of the game. When you become a Jane, you not only join an athletic group of girls with a history of success, but a sisterhood of women you can rely on whether you're on or off the field. Over the past decade, the Janes have consistently made it to the regional competition level in collegiate ultimate and we believe nationals will be within our reach in the near future. During the fall semester Calamity Jane focuses on recruiting enthusiastic, open, and hardworking women to join the team. No previous experience with Ultimate is required as we take any amount of time necessary to teach new players the basics. The fall is mostly dedicated to fun learning tournaments (approximately 3-5 tournaments; always on weekends and always within driving distance of campus) and skill development. The spring semester, on the other hand, is our real season. The Janes usually compete in around 5 tournaments leading up to sectionals, regionals, and nationals. We play against other women's teams from around the Midwest and even make an annual trip to Louisiana for the Mardi Gras tournament. Whether you've never played a sport in your life or you're a determined athlete wanting to compete as a collegiate athlete, the Janes would like to welcome you to the team. If you have any questions about Calamity Jane Ultimate or our practice schedule, please e-mail us at: iujaneultimate@gmail.com",

The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance and Uplift were adopted as cardinal principles.

Some of the children are born with heart defects but many develop them through simple illnesses like strep throat going untreated. To date, Save a Child's Heart have saved the lives of more than 4,400 children from 55 countries in Africa, South America, Europe, Asia, and throughout the Middle East and trained more than 100 medical team members from these countries. At Indiana University we will plan and coordinate fundraising events where proceeds go directly to the Save a Child's Heart Foundation. There will also be positions for members who would like to do media creation, social media promotion or other necessary tasks that are crucial to the club. Also as an organization we will have fundraising goals that the members will strive to achieve. As the Save a Child's Heart mantra goes, Mending Hearts, Building Bridges.",

    "fullDescription": "During the fall of 1986, Baltazar Mendoza-Madrigal began to explore the idea of establishing a Latino based Fraternity at the University of Iowa. After months of intensive research, Baltazar Mendoza-Madrigal called a special meeting on Monday, March 7, 1986 with some of the Latino students at the Chicano Indian American Cultural Center in the University of Iowa. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need and feasibility of creating a new social Fraternity with an emphasis on the Latino Culture.\n\nAt that point in time, the student body at the University of Iowa was predominantly Caucasian. In addition, the Latino community on campus was divided into different social groups. As a result, the students who attended the first meeting wanted to solidify and unify the Latino community. Furthermore, the students wanted to promote a positive image of Latinos in the University.\n\nAfter the first meeting, the enthusiasm in favor of the Fraternity was so encouraging that the word spread throughout the University of Iowa. Everyone knew that something special was about to take place. On Friday, April 4, 1986, the members finalized the philosophy and ideology of the Organization. Hence, April 4, 1986, is the official founding date of the Fraternity.\n\nThe Eighteen Founding Fathers established Sigma Lambda Beta with the following principles in mind BROTHERHOOD, SCHOLARSHIP, CULTURAL AWARENESS and COMMUNITY SERVICE. Our Founding Fathers had a dream and VISION that our Honorable Fraternity could promote a positive image of the Latino Community in the University of Iowa and other Universities located throughout the Nation by scholastic achievements, eternal Brotherhood, the dissemination of our unique and rich culture, and service to our community. Furthermore, as our Honorable Fraternity expanded and grew in the late eighties, the new and younger Brothers worked hard by trying their best to carry out the founding principles of our Organization. Hence, those Brothers tried to carry the torch and VISION of our Founding Fathers. The Brothers who were initiated in the early nineties, mid nineties, late nineties, and early millennium are keeping the light shining and working hard to promote a positive image of our people and our community throughout the Nation. The Brothers have the VISION that members of our community will graduate from college, pursue a graduate degree, join the professional work force, help the younger members of our community, serve our community, and educate others through cultural awareness.\n\nIn twenty years of existence, Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc. has expanded to the following states: AL, AZ, CA, CO, FL, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MA, MI, MN, MO, NE, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, TX, WA and WI. Expansion of our organization has also reached Puerto Rico. The Fraternity can be found at over 100 Universities. Furthermore, the Fraternity has 17 strong Alumni Associations. The following men are the Founding Fathers of Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc.:\n\nMARIO BUENDIA\nENRIQUE CARBAJAL\nTHOMAS CARRASQUILLO\nMANUEL CHAVARRIA\nJOSE FONG\nRUDOLFO GARZA\nLUIS JIMENEZ\nLUIS MARQUEZ\nBALTAZAR MENDOZA MADRIGAL\nERIC MONTES\nKUY OU\nOLAKUNLE OYEYEMI\nJAIME RAMIREZ\nOLIVERO RIVERA\nJUAN JOSE ROJAS CARDONA\nEUGENIO SORIA\nJUAN VALDEZ\nRICARDO ZAMUDIO\n\nSigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Incorporated is committed to developing individuals to their fullest potentials in order to help serve the needs and wants of our people. As members, Brothers learn to open their eyes to see the possibilities that are open to all students, to share thoughts and ideas, and to recognize the potential that we as a united front can and will illustrate which will keep our shared values alive and working. Each Brother has the responsibility to develop and utilize his own skills and assets in anyway that may contribute to the overall success of the Fraternity, and more importantly help improve our community, country, and the world.",

That'll get them thinking (Torres)Full recap of bullet points. Not the same as being here, but I know you all want to know what's up at #EIJ16 https://t.co/mL1jyVmxEKAs millennials, we need to take constructive criticism as that. Brannen says millennials tend to think criticism is personal, but it's not.Brannen: Be bold and aim high. Take risks. \"If you don't at least attempt it, you'll never know what would have happened.\" #EIJ16Torres adds, \"When you screw up, own it.\" Take the blame, don't blame others.Now is the time to fail, Mike Brannen says. Everyone screws up at some point, but screwing up in college is the time, not in the pro world.Make sure you know how to save your work for future reference and keep track of it, Stacey Welsh says.LeValdo says a thing among millennials is making the story about them. Stop, be humble. It's not about you.For many diversity groups, anyone can join to learn more about different cultures other than their own.Rhonda LeValdo, faculty at Haskell Indian Nations Univ., says to make friends from diverse backgrounds so you can cover these diverse groupsBefore an interview, prepare. Learn as much as you can about the company, and be sure you can answer why you want to work there. #EIJ16Torres: \"You can't have too many skills.\" #EIJ16On a similar note, take on or at least understand multiple beats. \"The more beats you can cover, the more valuable you become.\"Hearing from the pros about finding jobs out of college. Ricardo Torres says to be the LeBron James of journalism — be versatile in skills.Day 2 of #EIJ16, let's go!Carter-Long: \"Disability used to be a diagnosis. Now it's an identity, a community and shared history that hasn't been told.\"Carter-Long suggests \"swaggers with\" or referring to a wheelchair as a \"chariot of freedom.\"In the argument of \"people-first\" or \"disability-first\" terminology, the best way to go is to ask your source.Terms to avoid: \"confined to a wheelchair,\" \"epileptic fit\" (use seizure), eliminate \"stricken with\"/\"suffers from\"/\"victim of\" #EIJ16^that comes from Lawrence Carter-Long of the National Council on DisabilityWhen people give their \"litanies\" of under-represented groups (LGBTQ, PoC, etc.), you can't be afraid to use the word \"disability.\"When there are stories relevant to disabilities, journalists often aren't telling the right stories or asking the right questions.Time for \"Getting Beyond Stereotypes: Better Disability Journalism.\"  Time to learn more about what we as journalists can do better.As journalists and leaders, it's our job to identify and address these biases. We can't eliminate bias, but we can identify and adapt.Also, 33 percent of Hispanic people said the news media accurately portrays their community. 25 percent of African-Americans said the same.Right now, 8 percent of Americans trust the news media. \nAnd that's the lowest it's ever been.Per the Census Bureau and RTDNA, 62.6% of the U.S. is white. In July 2016, 76.9% of TV newsrooms were white. And that trend is \"worsening\"Per a @ColorOfChange study, 75% of criminals represented on news stations are black, but in reality, 51% of people arrested are black.Per a Pew Study, 61 percent of Americans said,\"Our country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites\" (2016)Though race, religion and politics are things we shouldn't talk about with friends, we need to talk about it before it becomes a problem.Up next: \"Race, Religion and Politics: Leading Community Conversation.\"Hardman: Sometimes showing up without a microphone and just listening to your audience says a lot.\"We're so reliant now on getting things online, but I've been in so many situations where that's not an option.\" -Jesse Hardman.Even if a rumor is small, you need to think about where it could lead. If it could be dangerous, it needs to be corrected before it spreads.Campbell: \"There's no such thing as a stupid rumor.\"Many times, these rumors reflect fears, and we as journalists need to report what's realOne key to reporting: Build trust in your audience now so that they trust you in a crisis. #EIJ16Many tribal communities face a lack of access to critical information (or even 911 services) and that's what Native Public Media is for.It's not about the quantity of information, but the quality in times of crisis, Alison Campbell says. #EIJ16First up today — Keep Calm and Communicate: New Ways to Engage with your Audience During a Crisis. #EIJ16Adviser Joe Coleman and chapter president Jamie Zega are on the way to @spj_tweets #EIJ16!

    "fullDescription": "Student Athletic Board has been an integral part of the Indiana University Athletic Department and student body since 1956. As time has passed, the organization has grown and its responsibilities within the athletic department have continued to expand. SAB was created to give the athletic department a link to the students. In return, SAB provides students the opportunity to be an active part of the planning, organizing, and successful completion of athletic events. Any student can become a crimson guard member. As a member of SAB, there are many opportunities available for you. The roles of SAB are very diverse. Some of them include ball running at soccer and field hockey games, organizing campus activities like Homecoming and Parent's Weekend, and simply cheering on the Hoosier teams at a Spirit Section. These are just a few of the tasks that SAB performs to assist the athletic department and all varsity sports. The organization relies on the dedication of its 16 Directors, approximately 100 Committee Chairpersons and around 800 Crimson Guard Members to carry out its responsibilities. Each varsity sport at IU has Directors who are responsible for making sure that that head coach's needs are met. The director also works to increase student and community attendance at athletic events (many of them free with a student ID) by working with the Athletics Marketing Office to promote special events. The mission of SAB is to be The Spirit Behind IU Athletics. This is accomplished by encouraging student involvement in all Indiana University athletic events. As an SAB member, you become a part of the tremendous history surrounding Indiana University and IU athletics. If you would like to join this organization, please email sab@indiana.edu.",

He was a very athletic, outgoing teenaged boy that loved life. He had an undetected genetic heart condition his whole life and never knew about it. September 25, 2013 at football practice, he collapsed and passed away due to his heart condition. The Play for Jake Foundation raises awareness for undetected heart conditions and provides free heart screenings in young people. Our group's goal is to help support this foundation and to raise awareness as much as possible on at Indiana University. We will also have fundraisers to raise money to show our support for this awesome foundation. All of the proceeds will be sent to the Play for Jake Foundation.

Beyond the campus, URSA aspires to be a link to the Bloomington and Indiana communities by organizing field trips to places of religious and scholastic interest.",

Every trip will have a different agenda, but some of the events may include hiking, picnics, picture taking, campfires, camping, meteor shower viewing, disc golf, kayaking, caving, philanthropy events, social events at restaurants, etc. Therefore, this club offers many different opportunities for students to get outside, explore, and become closer with the unique area around them. Along with recognizing the beauty of the area in which they live, students will also be able to meet other students who have similar interests. Experience is not needed, and everyone will be able to have fun on the trips.",
