    "fullDescription": "Alpha Delta Pi holds the distinction of being the first secret society in the world for college women. Alpha Delta Pi is proud to have over 140 collegiate chapters throughout the United States and Canada. We provide life skills like leadership development through holding chapter offices, encouragement and assistance to foster scholastic achievement and stress the importance of higher education, opportunities to serve our communities through philanthropic events, and lasting, lifelong friendships. Our Total Membership Education program offers our members timely, relevant programming to help develop well-rounded women. Membership in Alpha Delta Pi is not just for four years. It's for a lifetime. Mission statement Established in 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is committed to sisterhood, values and ethics, high academic standards and social responsibility. Values Scholarship Scholarship is very important to the Greek community. Alpha Delta Pi expects that each of its members will be committed to high academic standards and will exemplify that commitment through classroom attendance and performance. Chapters provide educational programs, chapter and campus resource information, and motivation and recognition programs. We are committed to a legacy of learning to help members prepare for the future and create a desire to continue learning throughout their lifetime. Leadership Greek life provides outstanding leadership opportunities. Each chapter is self-governing, thus relying on the talents of its members for its success. Members learn important lessons of leadership as members of ADPis Executive Board or as officers on a programming team. Some take the reins as leaders in their Campus Panhellenic association. Members are encouraged to take on leadership roles in campus and community organizations, as well. Service The Greek community donates considerable time and effort to helping philanthropic efforts around the world. Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Chapters organize annual events to raise money for RMHC, as well as participate in other Greek and campus service events. Philanthropy gives our members a sense of purpose and perspective, and it reinforces a lifelong commitment of giving to others.\nFriendship Its not just four years it's for a lifetime. A fundamental part of membership is the opportunity to share the bond of sisterhood through the successes and challenges of college. Within the chapter, members find support, encouragement, fun, and a connection unlike any other. Those bonds continue long after graduation as members connect and reconnect with members from coast to coast. Social A robust social experience is one of the many benefits of Greek life. Chapters participate in campus Homecoming and Greek Week events; host formals, date parties, and mixers with other Greek organizations; and host special events with alumnae and parents. Chapter leaders work hard to ensure safe and fun social events are a part of their members lives. Commitment to Philanthropy & Service The House That Love Built Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Alpha Delta Pi has contributed over $2 million to this worthwhile effort. RMHC supports Ronald McDonald Houses in local communities and funds grants to other nonprofit organizations whose programs focus on children in need. Today, 271 Ronald McDonald Houses in 30 countries and regions help keep families with seriously ill or injured children together when they need it most by offering them a comfortable, temporary residence in proximity to a medical facility. In addition to donating money to this incredible organization, collegiate chapters and alumnae associations spend their time and energy volunteering at local Ronald McDonald Houses. Alpha Delta Pi Foundation The mission of the Alpha Delta Pi Foundation, Inc. is to provide essential resources for Alpha",

This past April, Alpha Xi Delta held its first annual \"Step it Up 3k\", a 3k walk/run benefiting Autism Speaks, Inc. With the support of many other greek affiliations on campus and the community, an amazing $17,000 was raised for Autism Speaks in just the first year of the event. This involvement extends to campus-wide events such as Safe Halloween, EveryBODY week, Safe Sisters, The Body Project, and IUDM. Alpha Xi Delta is looking forward to this semester with all of their new members!",

    "fullDescription": "American Student Radio Mission Statement Goals: This is a station run by students, for students with input from journalism professors and acclaimed national professionals. American Student Radio is a national publication and a national classroom: A forum for learning to make useful journalism that enables a civil society. Everyone should be able to take something from our shows and online content. Educational – There are public, national arguments over what journalism is and what it should become. This is what we think journalism should be: A civic-minded pledge to represent diverse human experiences and perspectives on the events that we share as a community that. American Student Radio is a forum for this generation to learn how to achieve this and form and sustain a set of national best practices for this generation. Empowering – American Student Radio is an opportunity for students across the country to create their own professional media dialogue and form a new national journalistic network for this generation. It will connect people, but it is not social media. It is a journalistic forum for students across the country to report on and consider the important issues of the day. Diverse – Student bodies, by definition, are full of different kinds of people. Yes, we’re young, but we come from different places and have different ethnic backgrounds and families. So while we share hardships and successes as Americans, we do so from different perspectives. American Student Radio will cover our diverse perspectives on shared issues. We are reporting from across the country to a nation. Ethical - It is our charge to set a civic tone, to create useful journalism. Members and contributors will work to anticipate all relevant sides of a national issue and report them fully and in context. We will also report our own journalistic process as we produce our work and invite discussion towards clarifying and establishing a national conversation about the responsibility of, and civic necessity for, ethical journalism. Innovative – We are the first of our kind. We are carving out a national forum for in the new media landscape, and this forum will be shaped by our imaginations. While we will practice the journalistic values and practices of fairness, research and civic responsibility, we will also challenge traditional definitions of ‘what is a story,’ ‘what is newsworthy’ and ‘what is useful to our community’ - with the insights of each unique generation of students that work through this station. Entertaining – This includes enlightenment, challenging our listeners, but also making our products worth listening to. Each show should include an element of originality and surprise. (Lovely.) Ethical Guidelines (I think these go in our packets for our staff and for contributors who want to file… and for our other various sundry partners as an FYI, but it should be separate from the mission. On the website, but in a different place…) Seek the truth and report it – Be honest, fair and open in our opinions – not inflammatory. Seek the best expert, not just the one we know personally or agree with. Do not stereotype. Report all relevant sides. Do no harm – Make a concerted effort to be positive, do not be purposefully combative for the sake of being combative. Do good. Be compassionate. We are not a tabloid. Act Independently – This needs to be created FOR students BY students – stay free from conflicts of association, or fully disclose them. Hold sources/subjects accountable – don’t be afraid of this because we’re young. Be Accountable – We are students AND professionals. We owe it to our listeners to report stories accurately and swiftly correct ourselves if we are wrong. Our listeners, then, have every right to pellet us with t",

Working for multiple companies, firms, and institutions is almost expected from business graduates. However, almost no path is the same.

Many business students believe they know where they want to be in 10 or 20 years, however many are also unsure about how to get there. This organization is designed to bring clarity and real-life stories to the many students who are unsure, worried, and naïve of actual career paths that can be taken to achieve their career goals. This organization will utilize the over 100,000 Kelley alumni by bringing in Kelley graduates with all different types of degrees, in various types of positions, who graduates anywhere from 5-40 years ago to discuss their unique career paths. This will expose members to drastically different professional tracks that lead to many different areas.",

We understand the  opportunities and obstacles to developing a deeper faith in Jesus and His Church during the college years. We are here to walk with you; to help you to discover God's love and mercy; and to equip you to live this faith authentically. \n \nFrom move-in day through graduation, the college experience is a critical period in one's life and faith journey when young adults begin to crystallize their core values and the role faith will play in their lives.  \n\nOur goal is to work with as many students as we can to build up a community of missionary disciples who are on fire with Christ's loving and saving mission. We build this community of disciples through our celebration of the Sacraments, evangelization, faith sharing, social events, retreats, and service. Whether it be at Mass on Sunday, in small groups, on retreat, or over a plate of pasta at our weekly Sunday Suppers, every Hoosier Catholic has a place and everyone is called to become a disciple of Jesus Christ.\n \nIn the Fall of 2017, we welcomed five FOCUS missionaries to join our staff at St. Paul's. These missionaries significantly augmented our work of building, nurturing, and sending disciples at IU.\n\nWhether you are an incoming freshmen, an upperclassman making your way back to the Church, or anywhere else in your faith journey, we are here to serve you and I am here to walk this journey of faith with you. \n\nIt is the highest privilege to be your priest. If ever I can be of help, please give me a call or email.\n \nI hope to see you soon at St. Paul’s.",

    "fullDescription": "Vision Statement\nWe are a diverse community of Christians on Indiana University campus, living out our faith in Jesus Christ, equipped to fulfill our purpose in God's global plan.\nCore Values\nThese core values represent Chi Alpha Christian Fellowship most deeply held beliefs. They serve to guide our decisions, our leadership practices, and our community life. All our organizational actions will reflect these core values. 1. Community\nCommunity is a covenantal value shaping our mission to the university, and our priority to come together for biblically commanded action. The salvation of Jesus offers the forgiveness of sins and the incorporation into the people of God. As a collegiate community we are to be salt and light showing to the world what it means to authentically love God and one's neighbor. 2. Creativity\nGod is first revealed in Scripture as a creative God. We are committed to achieving commitment that appreciates the proven with an adaptive open eye to what He has in store today and beyond. His Spirit will release to us new ways, ideas, and plans. 3. Diversity\nA diverse community reflects a reconciliation of students to Jesus across all campus demographics. Each student possesses unique gifts, and we seek to encourage their full implementation in the community. We also accept diverse methods and approaches to ministry. We celebrate these unique ministry expressions as the demonstration of what God is doing on our campuses and encourage their effective application. 4. Excellence\nStriking performance, exceptional virtue, and continuous improvement exemplify excellence. Excellence goes the second mile by doing the best possible job. It calls out of us far more than we can possibly imagine. Excellence guides how we make significant choices. It causes us to discover our true God-given capabilities. Excellence depicts our approach to leadership, work, organization, and our life together. 5. Integrity\nIntegrity describes the state of sound moral uprightness. It is characterized by honesty, truthfulness, respect, and sincerity. Integrity in its simplest biblical definition means wholeness or completeness. Integrity invites oneself into a partnership with the Holy Spirit. This fosters an atmosphere of credibility and plausibility among those to whom we minister and within our communities on campus. Integrity promotes long-term success. 6. Servant-Leadership\nServant-leadership is a practice that places the good of those led and their progressive maturity over the self-interest of the leader. It shares power and status for the sake of the common good of each individual and the community. Its chief motive is to serve-first, as opposed to lead-first. The final goal is to empower others to become servants themselves.",

Other branches of Kiwanis include Key Club (high school students), Aktion Club, K-Kids, and Builders Club. Every week, we present members with different service opportunities around Bloomington that they can choose to participate in. It's a great way to meet people, and there are no obligations - you don't even have to be an official dues-paid member to volunteer! Our informational meetings are once a week, where you can sign-up for events you want to go to. We have socials, such as movie nights and intramural sports teams, club projects and service projects, Indiana district events (with 17 other colleges) and International events, speakers, leadership opportunities, networking, club updates, and so much more. It's a perfect way to get involved and to have lots of fun! Send us an email if you'd like to be on the Circle K email list for meeting updates and minutes! Note that to become an official resume-recognized member of Circle K International (also not required), you must pay membership dues and turn in an application form. Email us at the address below if you have any questions, or visit our Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/Circle-K-at-Indiana-University-314556585334494/.

Collins Living-Learning Center aims to provide a small but diverse residential community that addresses the needs and interests of the student.\nOur primary goal is to create an environment in which undergraduate students can succeed academically and grow as individuals in the process of exploring academic interests and avocations that will reward, challenge, and stimulate them. The objectives by which this goal is met are as varied as the student residents.\nUndergraduates are given the opportunity to participate in the formulation of their own accredited University curriculum through Collins’ Board of Educational Programming. This student-centered curriculum, paired with an experiential learning philosophy, makes the Collins program unique in the nation.\nWe encourage students to teach as well as learn. Our active program—which includes student-planned workshops, performances, publications, book clubs, and film series—allows individuals to take the lead in their areas of interest.\nCollins offers opportunities to learn and participate in a variety of artistic media in both academic and extracurricular settings. And, residents can grow in their understanding of the greater community by opting to participate in service activities that range from tutoring of children to environmental sustainability projects.\nWe provide quiet and comfortable study areas conducive to academic progress, as well as group meeting facilities, common areas, classrooms, computer labs, a student-run coffeeshop, and a library. Our full-service dining area serves as the social heart of the community and provides for a variety of dietary needs, including vegetarian and vegan options.\nAmple opportunities for academic, artistic, and philanthropic participation—in combination with providing for physical needs—establishes a culture in which it’s possible for students to expand their intellectual and personal horizons.",

The group's mission is to increase the level of transparency between the faculty and student body on programmatic issues and their effect on students. With these goals in mind, the CPSO strives to encourage a collaborative union with students and faculty in order to promote the enhancement of the student experience in the counseling psychology doctoral program. In addition to taking an active role in improving the faculty-student relationship in the counseling psychology doctoral program, the CPSO also strives to develop a sense of community within the student body. The CPSO committee is a governing body with two elected members, the president and vice president, and a variety of volunteer members. These committee members change yearly, and students from in-coming PhD cohorts are also encouraged to apply. Committee members include a president and vice president, a social chair, a diversity coordinator/chair, an international student chair, and a newsletter/blog chair. We also have a member-at-large and a master's student representative who is present at monthly meetings.",

Our mission is to use preventative health in order to improve the community’s physical, mental, and social well-being. By volunteering, fundraising, and event planning, we raise awareness for current issues in the field of public health and transform our community’s health from one based on sickness to one based on wellness and prevention. For instance, in the past, we’ve partnered with a caricature artist to host a self-image improvement event. We’ve also worked with Middle Way House to host a Healthy Halloween Carnival to raise awareness for obesity. Currently, we are excited to continue our volunteering with LIFEDesigns to boost the physical activity of their clients with disabilities. Our members truly do create a real impact in the community. As Dhara, a current member stated, “HealthNOW has pushed me to view health more holistically and engage with the community in meaningful ways such as working with LIFEDesigns to improve their clients' physical activity.” Our focus for the year 2017-2018 is to generate innovative events and volunteer opportunities which will empower individuals to make an impact in issues related to abortion, blood supply, the refugee crisis, and more!",

    "fullDescription": "Indiana University Dance Marathon (IUDM) is a student organization that raises funds and awareness for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. In 1991, IUDM was established by IU alumnus Jill Stewart shortly after her good friend Ryan White passed away from AIDS. Ryan was a hemophiliac at birth that contracted HIV through an infected blood transfusion. At the time of his diagnosis of HIV, very little was known about the disease and the associated stigma was stronger than ever. Ryan didn't want any of the children to have to experience the negative effects of the stigma, so he traveled the country speaking at various events, high schools, and even went in front of the President's Commission on AIDS. IUDM strives to instill the type of passion and dedication that Ryan had by raising funds and awareness for Riley Hospital. After fulfilling our endowment for the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center (RWIDC) at Riley Hospital, we began dedicated our funds to the Wells Center for Pediatric Research. IUDM is split up into 18 committees that work year-round to raise money, plan events, and prepare for our culminating event called the Dance Marathon. The Dance Marathon is a 36-hour event that consists of over 4,000 IU students (called Dancers) that stand on their feet in honor of Ryan White and the children being treated at Riley Hospital for Children. At the event there are various games, bands, Riley family speakers, IU faculty speakers, meals, snacks, and much, much more. At the end of the 36 hours, the total amount raised for Riley Hospital for that year is revealed. In 2018, IUDM raised over $4.1 million and in all IUDM has raised over $36 million for the kids at Riley Hospital. This year's Dance Marathon will take place in the IU Indoor Tennis Center on November 15th - November 17. Please check out www.iudm.org/register to join our IUDM family.",

The ACHA is a nationally recognized organization made up of club level ice hockey teams from all over the United States. The association is divided into four divisions and contains more than 200 men's and women's teams. Each division hosts their own National Championship at different locations around the country. Indiana University Ice Hockey has been in existence since 1968, but was not very prominent on the IU campus or Indiana in general until Dr. Leonard Burrello became their Faculty Advisor and General Manager. During the 1980s and 90s IU played in the now extinct MCHL and won 6 championships. In 1992 Dr. Rich Holdeman became head coach and led the Hoosiers to be the top Division II team in the nation and to a record 16 straight trips to the National Championships. Al Karlander, a former NHL and WHA player, coached the team in 2006 and 2007 and helped the team to a second place finish at the 2008 National Championship.  All of Indiana's games are played at the historic Frank Southern Center Ice Arena on the south side of Bloomington. Indiana University has one Ice Hockey team: - ACHA Division II Ice Hockey team. Plays in the Tri-State Collegiate Hockey League (TSCHL) from September to March.",

Through this festival, we wish to create a bridge to engender dialogue and collaboration between practitioners, students, scholars, and members of the Bloomington community who share an investment in human rights struggles occurring around the world. By engaging professors and students from a wide range of disciplines in the planning and implementation of the festival, we are focused on creating a professional team with experience in film studies, film production, and festival organizing. ILFF focus is international in scope, presenting films made both domestically and abroad. We are committed to bringing filmmakers with a diverse array of voices and perspectives to campus in order to enrich the quality of the discourse surrounding human rights at IU and in Bloomington. Furthermore, the festival aims at creating valuable resources for students interested in documentary filmmaking, human rights activism, and those who are interested in working with human rights documentaries as part of their scholarly projects.",

Artists and humanists help us think about the use of materials, the arrangement of space and time, and the presentation of information; they inspire us to experiment with style and expression; they draw us to beauty and sometimes its opposite; they help us navigate competing views and values; they teach us to pause and to play.\n\nIn a word, the arts and humanities challenge us to grow constantly, to question and advance our perceptions and beliefs, to lead an ever more thoughtful, more committed life. The council is dedicated to this process and protecting it as a vital component of IU’s larger educational mission.",

We generally concentrate on Savoy-style Lindy Hop, Charleston, and St. Louis Shag. However, we have also dabbled in other dance styles, including the Collegiate Shag, Balboa, and more! The Swing Club tends to favor historical dance styles, but we also mix it up with more modern music and dance. The Club offers weekly lesson series for both beginners and intermediate dancers each semester, as well as social dance opportunities and other events.",

    "fullDescription": "Calamity Jane Ultimate is rooted in respect, teamwork, and love of the game. When you become a Jane, you not only join an athletic group of girls with a history of success, but a sisterhood of women you can rely on whether you're on or off the field. Over the past decade, the Janes have consistently made it to the regional competition level in collegiate ultimate and we believe nationals will be within our reach in the near future. During the fall semester Calamity Jane focuses on recruiting enthusiastic, open, and hardworking women to join the team. No previous experience with Ultimate is required as we take any amount of time necessary to teach new players the basics. The fall is mostly dedicated to fun learning tournaments (approximately 3-5 tournaments; always on weekends and always within driving distance of campus) and skill development. The spring semester, on the other hand, is our real season. The Janes usually compete in around 5 tournaments leading up to sectionals, regionals, and nationals. We play against other women's teams from around the Midwest and even make an annual trip to Louisiana for the Mardi Gras tournament. Whether you've never played a sport in your life or you're a determined athlete wanting to compete as a collegiate athlete, the Janes would like to welcome you to the team. If you have any questions about Calamity Jane Ultimate or our practice schedule, please e-mail us at: iujaneultimate@gmail.com",

Because of our shared values, we want to foster an environment of respect and unity among all chapters. As an Executive Council, we will work to be a resource and guide for all chapters. We facilitate weekly Gavel meetings, work with the Student Activities Office to provide member education programs, sponsor and involve members in a variety of leadership development programs, and act as an overall representation for the entire Panhellenic Community. We also communicate with chapters to keep them informed about and involved with the overall community of IU and Bloomington.

    "fullDescription": "On December 1, 1987 at Binghamton University, Founding Mothers Cynthia Santiago-Guzman, Adriana Zamora-Tirado, Carmen Ibeth Garcia-Quinones and Carol Elizabeth Torres created an organization that would not only serve as a voice for women in an academic setting, but would also provide sincere sisterhood and unconditional support while actively promoting academic achievement, service to the community, and cultural enrichment. Over two decades and more than 30 campuses later, the Hermanas of Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc., continue the legacy of our Founders vision by effectively bridging the gap between the Latino community and the campuses we represent. Today, 22 years later, our goals and ideals continue to be exemplified in all of our Hermanas: Sisterhood, Academic Excellence, Leadership, Community Service, and Campus & Cultural Enrichment.\n\nThrough mutual courage, support, respect and love, our impenetrable bond of sisterhood unites Hermanas of African, African American, Argentinean, Belizian, Bolivian, Brazilian, Cape Verdean, Chicana, Chilean, Chinese, Colombian, Costa Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, English, Filipina, French, German, Guatemalan, Haitian, Hmong, Honduran, Italian, Irish, Jamaican, Jewish, Korean, Mexican, Native American, Nevisian, Nicaraguan, Nigerian, Panamanian, Paraguayan, Peruvian, Polish, Puerto Rican, Romanian, Salvadorian, Spanish and Uruguayan backgrounds to work towards common Goals and Ideals. Our relentless commitment to Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc., and to each other is why we consider our sisterhood ~ Our Hermandad ~ lasting Hasta La Muerte!\n\nThough Latina-based, Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc., is a non-discriminatory organization made up of women from all cultures, creed, disabilities, political beliefs, and sexual preferences.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring of 2006, the Alpha Eta Chapter was founded (as the Alpha Line) by:\n\n#1 Elenita Gui - Hermana Dirigida\n#2 Guadalupe Arroyo - Hermana Incandescente\n#3 Sarah Wells - Hermana Sobresaliente\n#4 Susana Mota - Hermana Avivadora\n#5 Patricia Mota - Hermana Decidida\n\nIn the Spring of 2007, the Alpha Eta Chapter welcomed their Beta Line:\n\n#1 Monica Ozaeta - Hermana Floración\n#2 Beverly Haro-Perez - Hermana Justicia\n#3 Marisol Arellano - Hermana Águila\n#4 Autumnlynn Glass - Hermana Piadosa\n#5 Rebeca (Laracuente) Shahrani - Hermana Caridad\n\nIn the Spring of 2008, the Alpha Eta Chapter welcomed their Gamma Line:\n\n#1 Maritza Arredondo - Hermana Alborada\n#2 Adriana Figueroa - Hermana Aspiración\n\nIn the Fall of 2009, the Alpha Eta Chapter welcomed their newest members, the Delta Line:\n\n#1 Elvia Malagon - Hermana Ladina\n#2 Jennifer Pizarro - Hermana Prometedora\n#3 Elizabeth Rivera - Hermana Escolástica\n#4 Sandra Lara - Hermana Armada\n#5 Alma Figueroa - Hermana Apreciada",

That'll get them thinking (Torres)Full recap of bullet points. Not the same as being here, but I know you all want to know what's up at #EIJ16 https://t.co/mL1jyVmxEKAs millennials, we need to take constructive criticism as that. Brannen says millennials tend to think criticism is personal, but it's not.Brannen: Be bold and aim high. Take risks. \"If you don't at least attempt it, you'll never know what would have happened.\" #EIJ16Torres adds, \"When you screw up, own it.\" Take the blame, don't blame others.Now is the time to fail, Mike Brannen says. Everyone screws up at some point, but screwing up in college is the time, not in the pro world.Make sure you know how to save your work for future reference and keep track of it, Stacey Welsh says.LeValdo says a thing among millennials is making the story about them. Stop, be humble. It's not about you.For many diversity groups, anyone can join to learn more about different cultures other than their own.Rhonda LeValdo, faculty at Haskell Indian Nations Univ., says to make friends from diverse backgrounds so you can cover these diverse groupsBefore an interview, prepare. Learn as much as you can about the company, and be sure you can answer why you want to work there. #EIJ16Torres: \"You can't have too many skills.\" #EIJ16On a similar note, take on or at least understand multiple beats. \"The more beats you can cover, the more valuable you become.\"Hearing from the pros about finding jobs out of college. Ricardo Torres says to be the LeBron James of journalism — be versatile in skills.Day 2 of #EIJ16, let's go!Carter-Long: \"Disability used to be a diagnosis. Now it's an identity, a community and shared history that hasn't been told.\"Carter-Long suggests \"swaggers with\" or referring to a wheelchair as a \"chariot of freedom.\"In the argument of \"people-first\" or \"disability-first\" terminology, the best way to go is to ask your source.Terms to avoid: \"confined to a wheelchair,\" \"epileptic fit\" (use seizure), eliminate \"stricken with\"/\"suffers from\"/\"victim of\" #EIJ16^that comes from Lawrence Carter-Long of the National Council on DisabilityWhen people give their \"litanies\" of under-represented groups (LGBTQ, PoC, etc.), you can't be afraid to use the word \"disability.\"When there are stories relevant to disabilities, journalists often aren't telling the right stories or asking the right questions.Time for \"Getting Beyond Stereotypes: Better Disability Journalism.\"  Time to learn more about what we as journalists can do better.As journalists and leaders, it's our job to identify and address these biases. We can't eliminate bias, but we can identify and adapt.Also, 33 percent of Hispanic people said the news media accurately portrays their community. 25 percent of African-Americans said the same.Right now, 8 percent of Americans trust the news media. \nAnd that's the lowest it's ever been.Per the Census Bureau and RTDNA, 62.6% of the U.S. is white. In July 2016, 76.9% of TV newsrooms were white. And that trend is \"worsening\"Per a @ColorOfChange study, 75% of criminals represented on news stations are black, but in reality, 51% of people arrested are black.Per a Pew Study, 61 percent of Americans said,\"Our country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites\" (2016)Though race, religion and politics are things we shouldn't talk about with friends, we need to talk about it before it becomes a problem.Up next: \"Race, Religion and Politics: Leading Community Conversation.\"Hardman: Sometimes showing up without a microphone and just listening to your audience says a lot.\"We're so reliant now on getting things online, but I've been in so many situations where that's not an option.\" -Jesse Hardman.Even if a rumor is small, you need to think about where it could lead. If it could be dangerous, it needs to be corrected before it spreads.Campbell: \"There's no such thing as a stupid rumor.\"Many times, these rumors reflect fears, and we as journalists need to report what's realOne key to reporting: Build trust in your audience now so that they trust you in a crisis. #EIJ16Many tribal communities face a lack of access to critical information (or even 911 services) and that's what Native Public Media is for.It's not about the quantity of information, but the quality in times of crisis, Alison Campbell says. #EIJ16First up today — Keep Calm and Communicate: New Ways to Engage with your Audience During a Crisis. #EIJ16Adviser Joe Coleman and chapter president Jamie Zega are on the way to @spj_tweets #EIJ16!

    "fullDescription": "Student Athletic Board has been an integral part of the Indiana University Athletic Department and student body since 1956. As time has passed, the organization has grown and its responsibilities within the athletic department have continued to expand. SAB was created to give the athletic department a link to the students. In return, SAB provides students the opportunity to be an active part of the planning, organizing, and successful completion of athletic events. Any student can become a crimson guard member. As a member of SAB, there are many opportunities available for you. The roles of SAB are very diverse. Some of them include ball running at soccer and field hockey games, organizing campus activities like Homecoming and Parent's Weekend, and simply cheering on the Hoosier teams at a Spirit Section. These are just a few of the tasks that SAB performs to assist the athletic department and all varsity sports. The organization relies on the dedication of its 16 Directors, approximately 100 Committee Chairpersons and around 800 Crimson Guard Members to carry out its responsibilities. Each varsity sport at IU has Directors who are responsible for making sure that that head coach's needs are met. The director also works to increase student and community attendance at athletic events (many of them free with a student ID) by working with the Athletics Marketing Office to promote special events. The mission of SAB is to be The Spirit Behind IU Athletics. This is accomplished by encouraging student involvement in all Indiana University athletic events. As an SAB member, you become a part of the tremendous history surrounding Indiana University and IU athletics. If you would like to join this organization, please email sab@indiana.edu.",

We branch off from the actual foundation, the Play for Jake Foundation, that is based in LaPorte, Indiana. The story behind this foundation is about a boy named Jake West. He was a very athletic, outgoing teenaged boy that loved life. He had an undetected genetic heart condition his whole life and never knew about it. September 25, 2013 at football practice, he collapsed and passed away due to his heart condition. The Play for Jake Foundation raises awareness for undetected heart conditions and provides free heart screenings in young people. Our group's goal is to help support this foundation and to raise awareness as much as possible on at Indiana University. We will also have fundraisers to raise money to show our support for this awesome foundation. All of the proceeds will be sent to the Play for Jake Foundation.
