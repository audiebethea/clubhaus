We practice open-hand technique (throws, locks, pins), as well as weapons -- wooden sword (bokken), knife (tanto), and staff (jo). Aikido is a non-competitive martial art. We usually practice techniques with a partner, with each party taking turns to do and receive the technique. Testing and promotion are achieved through the demonstration of various techniques appropriate to the level of the practitioner. We always welcome beginners! If you are interested in learning more about Aikido, you are welcome to come to one of our practice sessions to observe a class, talk to the members of the club, or try doing some techniques yourself! Make sure you wear loose clothes such as sweat pants and a t-shirt if you don't have an Aikido uniform. Practice is open to IU students/faculty/staff and to the public. All backgrounds and experience levels are welcome! Meeting times and locations are: Mondays and Wednesday: 7:30pm - 9:00pm, WIC 095 Saturday: 10:00am - 11:30am, WIC 095 In addition, IU offers a 1 credit Aikido class, HPER 153.

    "fullDescription": "Alpha Delta Pi holds the distinction of being the first secret society in the world for college women. Alpha Delta Pi is proud to have over 140 collegiate chapters throughout the United States and Canada. We provide life skills like leadership development through holding chapter offices, encouragement and assistance to foster scholastic achievement and stress the importance of higher education, opportunities to serve our communities through philanthropic events, and lasting, lifelong friendships. Our Total Membership Education program offers our members timely, relevant programming to help develop well-rounded women. Membership in Alpha Delta Pi is not just for four years. It's for a lifetime. Mission statement Established in 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is committed to sisterhood, values and ethics, high academic standards and social responsibility. Values Scholarship Scholarship is very important to the Greek community. Alpha Delta Pi expects that each of its members will be committed to high academic standards and will exemplify that commitment through classroom attendance and performance. Chapters provide educational programs, chapter and campus resource information, and motivation and recognition programs. We are committed to a legacy of learning to help members prepare for the future and create a desire to continue learning throughout their lifetime. Leadership Greek life provides outstanding leadership opportunities. Each chapter is self-governing, thus relying on the talents of its members for its success. Members learn important lessons of leadership as members of ADPis Executive Board or as officers on a programming team. Some take the reins as leaders in their Campus Panhellenic association. Members are encouraged to take on leadership roles in campus and community organizations, as well. Service The Greek community donates considerable time and effort to helping philanthropic efforts around the world. Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Chapters organize annual events to raise money for RMHC, as well as participate in other Greek and campus service events. Philanthropy gives our members a sense of purpose and perspective, and it reinforces a lifelong commitment of giving to others.\nFriendship Its not just four years it's for a lifetime. A fundamental part of membership is the opportunity to share the bond of sisterhood through the successes and challenges of college. Within the chapter, members find support, encouragement, fun, and a connection unlike any other. Those bonds continue long after graduation as members connect and reconnect with members from coast to coast. Social A robust social experience is one of the many benefits of Greek life. Chapters participate in campus Homecoming and Greek Week events; host formals, date parties, and mixers with other Greek organizations; and host special events with alumnae and parents. Chapter leaders work hard to ensure safe and fun social events are a part of their members lives. Commitment to Philanthropy & Service The House That Love Built Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Alpha Delta Pi has contributed over $2 million to this worthwhile effort. RMHC supports Ronald McDonald Houses in local communities and funds grants to other nonprofit organizations whose programs focus on children in need. Today, 271 Ronald McDonald Houses in 30 countries and regions help keep families with seriously ill or injured children together when they need it most by offering them a comfortable, temporary residence in proximity to a medical facility. In addition to donating money to this incredible organization, collegiate chapters and alumnae associations spend their time and energy volunteering at local Ronald McDonald Houses.

    "fullDescription": "Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded to provide opportunities for the Jewish college man seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience. We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career. Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity's 94-year history, over 83,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,000 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago. Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow's Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow's Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time. Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a learning laboratory, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood. Alpha Epsilon Pi prepares young men for their role in life as responsible citizens. Therefore, our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity, though non-discriminatory and open to all who are willing to espouse its purpose and values.",

American Student Radio is a national publication and a national classroom: A forum for learning to make useful journalism that enables a civil society. Everyone should be able to take something from our shows and online content. Educational – There are public, national arguments over what journalism is and what it should become. This is what we think journalism should be: A civic-minded pledge to represent diverse human experiences and perspectives on the events that we share as a community that. American Student Radio is a forum for this generation to learn how to achieve this and form and sustain a set of national best practices for this generation. Empowering – American Student Radio is an opportunity for students across the country to create their own professional media dialogue and form a new national journalistic network for this generation. It will connect people, but it is not social media. It is a journalistic forum for students across the country to report on and consider the important issues of the day. Diverse – Student bodies, by definition, are full of different kinds of people. Yes, we’re young, but we come from different places and have different ethnic backgrounds and families. So while we share hardships and successes as Americans, we do so from different perspectives. American Student Radio will cover our diverse perspectives on shared issues. We are reporting from across the country to a nation. Ethical - It is our charge to set a civic tone, to create useful journalism. Members and contributors will work to anticipate all relevant sides of a national issue and report them fully and in context. We will also report our own journalistic process as we produce our work and invite discussion towards clarifying and establishing a national conversation about the responsibility of, and civic necessity for, ethical journalism. Innovative – We are the first of our kind. We are carving out a national forum for in the new media landscape, and this forum will be shaped by our imaginations. While we will practice the journalistic values and practices of fairness, research and civic responsibility, we will also challenge traditional definitions of ‘what is a story,’ ‘what is newsworthy’ and ‘what is useful to our community’ - with the insights of each unique generation of students that work through this station. Entertaining – This includes enlightenment, challenging our listeners, but also making our products worth listening to. Each show should include an element of originality and surprise. (Lovely.) Ethical Guidelines (I think these go in our packets for our staff and for contributors who want to file… and for our other various sundry partners as an FYI, but it should be separate from the mission. On the website, but in a different place…) Seek the truth and report it – Be honest, fair and open in our opinions – not inflammatory. Seek the best expert, not just the one we know personally or agree with. Do not stereotype. Report all relevant sides. Do no harm – Make a concerted effort to be positive, do not be purposefully combative for the sake of being combative. Do good. Be compassionate. We are not a tabloid. Act Independently – This needs to be created FOR students BY students – stay free from conflicts of association, or fully disclose them. Hold sources/subjects accountable – don’t be afraid of this because we’re young. Be Accountable – We are students AND professionals. We owe it to our listeners to report stories accurately and swiftly correct ourselves if we are wrong. Our listeners, then, have every right to pellet us with t",

Eminent scholars such as Felix Oinas, Janis Penikis, Toivo Raun, and Inta Carpenter have served or continue to serve as IU faculty members. Recently, IU hosted both the 16th conference of the Association for the Advancement of Baltic Studies and the Baltic Studies Summer Institute. IU also regularly offers three levels of both Finnish and Estonian. BaFSA is an outgrowth of this commitment and corresponding student interest. BaFSA aims to support and promote a multidisciplinary community of scholarly inquiry into Finnish, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian society, history, culture, and language. In pursuit of this goal, BaFSA sponsors academic and cultural events. The association also acts as a link to other organizations and institutions engaged in like-minded activities. Special emphasis is put on encouraging interest among those still unacquainted with Baltic and Finnish studies. Membership is open to all interested persons wishing to participate in the association and the general public and undergraduates are strongly encouraged to attend its activities. BaFSA is affiliated with both the department of Central Eurasian Studies (CEUS) and the Russian and East European Institute (REEI). BaFSA's faculty advisors are CEUS professor Toivo Raun and lecturer Piibi-Kai Kivik.",

They serve to guide our decisions, our leadership practices, and our community life. All our organizational actions will reflect these core values. 1. Community\nCommunity is a covenantal value shaping our mission to the university, and our priority to come together for biblically commanded action. The salvation of Jesus offers the forgiveness of sins and the incorporation into the people of God. As a collegiate community we are to be salt and light showing to the world what it means to authentically love God and one's neighbor. 2. Creativity\nGod is first revealed in Scripture as a creative God. We are committed to achieving commitment that appreciates the proven with an adaptive open eye to what He has in store today and beyond. His Spirit will release to us new ways, ideas, and plans. 3. Diversity\nA diverse community reflects a reconciliation of students to Jesus across all campus demographics. Each student possesses unique gifts, and we seek to encourage their full implementation in the community. We also accept diverse methods and approaches to ministry. We celebrate these unique ministry expressions as the demonstration of what God is doing on our campuses and encourage their effective application. 4. Excellence\nStriking performance, exceptional virtue, and continuous improvement exemplify excellence. Excellence goes the second mile by doing the best possible job. It calls out of us far more than we can possibly imagine. Excellence guides how we make significant choices. It causes us to discover our true God-given capabilities. Excellence depicts our approach to leadership, work, organization, and our life together. 5. Integrity\nIntegrity describes the state of sound moral uprightness. It is characterized by honesty, truthfulness, respect, and sincerity. Integrity in its simplest biblical definition means wholeness or completeness. Integrity invites oneself into a partnership with the Holy Spirit. This fosters an atmosphere of credibility and plausibility among those to whom we minister and within our communities on campus. Integrity promotes long-term success. 6. Servant-Leadership\nServant-leadership is a practice that places the good of those led and their progressive maturity over the self-interest of the leader. It shares power and status for the sake of the common good of each individual and the community. Its chief motive is to serve-first, as opposed to lead-first. The final goal is to empower others to become servants themselves.",

The program grew to prominence in the 1980s under the direction of Dr. Leonard Burrello, who led the team to 4 MCHL championships in 1983, 1984, 1988, and 1989. The most prominent era in IU Hockey history occurred under the direction of coach Rich Holdeman, who led the program from 1992-2006. During his tenure, Holdeman moved the program into the ACHA where he immediately made the program a national powerhouse. Holdeman led the team to 11 straight national tournaments with 4 national runner-up finishes. In 2013, coach Holdeman was elected to the ACHA Hall of Fame, making him one of just 12 members to ever receive this honor. Today, the program plays at the Division 3 level of the ACHA, and is a member of the newly formed Indiana Collegiate Hockey Conference (ICHC) which features Indiana University, Ball State University, Butler University, Miami University, Trine University, and the University of Indianapolis. The team plays roughly a 30 game schedule with the season culminating in the ICHC Conference Tournament, as well as a hopeful bid to play in the regional and national tournaments. The team has advanced to the regional tournament the past two seasons, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018. The team plays their home games at the Frank Southern Ice Arena in Bloomington.",

At Indiana University, we plan to build a foundation of volunteers and leaders, each motivated to make a profound impact on our world. Global Medical Brigades is an international network of university clubs and volunteer organizations that travel to developing countries to perform health care in communities without access to medicine otherwise. Global Medical Brigades also works alongside Global Water Brigades, Public Health Brigades, Business Brigades, Microfinance Brigades, Environmental Brigades, and Arts Brigades to help ensure the communities we serve are provided with the services they need to further ensure their health treatment and long term sustainability. Our current emphasis is in the countries of Nicaragua and Panama. In its first year of existence in 2009-2010 Global Brigades at IU took 93 students and 7 professionals to Honduras and Panama to work on public health, medical, business, and clean water projects. Along with brigades from different parts of the country, they were able to accomplish the following: provided 16,771 patients with medical care, improved living conditions of 104 people using public health projects, provided 125 homes with access to clean water, opened 28 new savings accounts, established 32 potential borrowers, provided sustainable business structures for 50 members, provided legal stability for 50 members, and consulted 200 members on improving the efficiency and profitability of their business. These efforts have been strengthened every year since and will continue to grow in the future. Global Brigades is leading the way in sustainability in international development. With its unique holistic structure, through the many disciplined brigades, Global Brigades is able to offer lasting, sustainable solutions to communities in a way no other organization can.

    "fullDescription": "Indiana University Dance Marathon (IUDM) is a student organization that raises funds and awareness for Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. In 1991, IUDM was established by IU alumnus Jill Stewart shortly after her good friend Ryan White passed away from AIDS. Ryan was a hemophiliac at birth that contracted HIV through an infected blood transfusion. At the time of his diagnosis of HIV, very little was known about the disease and the associated stigma was stronger than ever. Ryan didn't want any of the children to have to experience the negative effects of the stigma, so he traveled the country speaking at various events, high schools, and even went in front of the President's Commission on AIDS. IUDM strives to instill the type of passion and dedication that Ryan had by raising funds and awareness for Riley Hospital. After fulfilling our endowment for the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center (RWIDC) at Riley Hospital, we began dedicated our funds to the Wells Center for Pediatric Research. IUDM is split up into 18 committees that work year-round to raise money, plan events, and prepare for our culminating event called the Dance Marathon. The Dance Marathon is a 36-hour event that consists of over 4,000 IU students (called Dancers) that stand on their feet in honor of Ryan White and the children being treated at Riley Hospital for Children. At the event there are various games, bands, Riley family speakers, IU faculty speakers, meals, snacks, and much, much more. At the end of the 36 hours, the total amount raised for Riley Hospital for that year is revealed. In 2018, IUDM raised over $4.1 million and in all IUDM has raised over $36 million for the kids at Riley Hospital. This year's Dance Marathon will take place in the IU Indoor Tennis Center on November 15th - November 17. Please check out www.iudm.org/register to join our IUDM family.",

When you become a Jane, you not only join an athletic group of girls with a history of success, but a sisterhood of women you can rely on whether you're on or off the field. Over the past decade, the Janes have consistently made it to the regional competition level in collegiate ultimate and we believe nationals will be within our reach in the near future. During the fall semester Calamity Jane focuses on recruiting enthusiastic, open, and hardworking women to join the team. No previous experience with Ultimate is required as we take any amount of time necessary to teach new players the basics. The fall is mostly dedicated to fun learning tournaments (approximately 3-5 tournaments; always on weekends and always within driving distance of campus) and skill development. The spring semester, on the other hand, is our real season. The Janes usually compete in around 5 tournaments leading up to sectionals, regionals, and nationals. We play against other women's teams from around the Midwest and even make an annual trip to Louisiana for the Mardi Gras tournament. Whether you've never played a sport in your life or you're a determined athlete wanting to compete as a collegiate athlete, the Janes would like to welcome you to the team.

    "fullDescription": "On Friday evening, November 17, 1911, three Howard University undergraduate students, with the assistance of their faculty adviser, gave birth to the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. This event occurred in the office of biology Professor Ernest E. Just, the faculty adviser, in the Science Hall (now known as Thirkield Hall). The three liberal arts students were Edgar A. Love, Oscar J. Cooper and Frank Coleman. From the initials of the Greek phrase meaning \"friendship is essential to the soul\", the name Omega Psi Phi was derived. The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance and Uplift were adopted as cardinal principles. The 'Zealous' Zeta Epsilon Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. was chartered at Indiana University on October 20, 1947. The men of the Zeta Epsilon thrive themselves to community service and uplift on the campus, in the city of Bloomington and beyond.",

Some of the children are born with heart defects but many develop them through simple illnesses like strep throat going untreated. To date, Save a Child's Heart have saved the lives of more than 4,400 children from 55 countries in Africa, South America, Europe, Asia, and throughout the Middle East and trained more than 100 medical team members from these countries. At Indiana University we will plan and coordinate fundraising events where proceeds go directly to the Save a Child's Heart Foundation. There will also be positions for members who would like to do media creation, social media promotion or other necessary tasks that are crucial to the club. Also as an organization we will have fundraising goals that the members will strive to achieve. As the Save a Child's Heart mantra goes, Mending Hearts, Building Bridges.",

    "fullDescription": "During the fall of 1986, Baltazar Mendoza-Madrigal began to explore the idea of establishing a Latino based Fraternity at the University of Iowa. After months of intensive research, Baltazar Mendoza-Madrigal called a special meeting on Monday, March 7, 1986 with some of the Latino students at the Chicano Indian American Cultural Center in the University of Iowa. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need and feasibility of creating a new social Fraternity with an emphasis on the Latino Culture.\n\nAt that point in time, the student body at the University of Iowa was predominantly Caucasian. In addition, the Latino community on campus was divided into different social groups. As a result, the students who attended the first meeting wanted to solidify and unify the Latino community. Furthermore, the students wanted to promote a positive image of Latinos in the University.\n\nAfter the first meeting, the enthusiasm in favor of the Fraternity was so encouraging that the word spread throughout the University of Iowa. Everyone knew that something special was about to take place. On Friday, April 4, 1986, the members finalized the philosophy and ideology of the Organization. Hence, April 4, 1986, is the official founding date of the Fraternity.\n\nThe Eighteen Founding Fathers established Sigma Lambda Beta with the following principles in mind BROTHERHOOD, SCHOLARSHIP, CULTURAL AWARENESS and COMMUNITY SERVICE. Our Founding Fathers had a dream and VISION that our Honorable Fraternity could promote a positive image of the Latino Community in the University of Iowa and other Universities located throughout the Nation by scholastic achievements, eternal Brotherhood, the dissemination of our unique and rich culture, and service to our community. Furthermore, as our Honorable Fraternity expanded and grew in the late eighties, the new and younger Brothers worked hard by trying their best to carry out the founding principles of our Organization. Hence, those Brothers tried to carry the torch and VISION of our Founding Fathers. The Brothers who were initiated in the early nineties, mid nineties, late nineties, and early millennium are keeping the light shining and working hard to promote a positive image of our people and our community throughout the Nation. The Brothers have the VISION that members of our community will graduate from college, pursue a graduate degree, join the professional work force, help the younger members of our community, serve our community, and educate others through cultural awareness.\n\nIn twenty years of existence, Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc. has expanded to the following states: AL, AZ, CA, CO, FL, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, MA, MI, MN, MO, NE, NJ, NY, OH, OK, PA, RI, TX, WA and WI. Expansion of our organization has also reached Puerto Rico. The Fraternity can be found at over 100 Universities. Furthermore, the Fraternity has 17 strong Alumni Associations. The following men are the Founding Fathers of Sigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Inc.:\n\nMARIO BUENDIA\nENRIQUE CARBAJAL\nTHOMAS CARRASQUILLO\nMANUEL CHAVARRIA\nJOSE FONG\nRUDOLFO GARZA\nLUIS JIMENEZ\nLUIS MARQUEZ\nBALTAZAR MENDOZA MADRIGAL\nERIC MONTES\nKUY OU\nOLAKUNLE OYEYEMI\nJAIME RAMIREZ\nOLIVERO RIVERA\nJUAN JOSE ROJAS CARDONA\nEUGENIO SORIA\nJUAN VALDEZ\nRICARDO ZAMUDIO\n\nSigma Lambda Beta International Fraternity, Incorporated is committed to developing individuals to their fullest potentials in order to help serve the needs and wants of our people. As members, Brothers learn to open their eyes to see the possibilities that are open to all students, to share thoughts and ideas, and to recognize the potential that we as a united front can and will illustrate which will keep our shared values alive and working. Each Brother has the responsibility to develop and utilize his own skills and assets in anyway that may contribute to the overall success of the Fraternity, and more importantly help improve our community, country, and the world.",

SAB was created to give the athletic department a link to the students. In return, SAB provides students the opportunity to be an active part of the planning, organizing, and successful completion of athletic events. Any student can become a crimson guard member. As a member of SAB, there are many opportunities available for you. The roles of SAB are very diverse. Some of them include ball running at soccer and field hockey games, organizing campus activities like Homecoming and Parent's Weekend, and simply cheering on the Hoosier teams at a Spirit Section. These are just a few of the tasks that SAB performs to assist the athletic department and all varsity sports. The organization relies on the dedication of its 16 Directors, approximately 100 Committee Chairpersons and around 800 Crimson Guard Members to carry out its responsibilities. Each varsity sport at IU has Directors who are responsible for making sure that that head coach's needs are met. The director also works to increase student and community attendance at athletic events (many of them free with a student ID) by working with the Athletics Marketing Office to promote special events. The mission of SAB is to be The Spirit Behind IU Athletics. This is accomplished by encouraging student involvement in all Indiana University athletic events. As an SAB member, you become a part of the tremendous history surrounding Indiana University and IU athletics. If you would like to join this organization, please email sab@indiana.edu.",

September 25, 2013 at football practice, he collapsed and passed away due to his heart condition. The Play for Jake Foundation raises awareness for undetected heart conditions and provides free heart screenings in young people. Our group's goal is to help support this foundation and to raise awareness as much as possible on at Indiana University. We will also have fundraisers to raise money to show our support for this awesome foundation. All of the proceeds will be sent to the Play for Jake Foundation.

    "fullDescription": "Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) is an ideologically conservative youth activism organization that was founded in 1960 as a coalition between traditional conservatives and libertarians. The purposes of YAF are to advocate for public policies consistent with the Sharon Statement, which was adopted by young conservatives at a meeting at the home of Mr. William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut on September 11, 1960: to promote social welfare and individual freedom; to study any legislation from any governmental bodies or agencies that seek to affect social and economic problems of the individual; to support the preservation and enhancement of individual freedom for all Americans; to provide aid and information to students and such young adults throughout the nation to assist them in achieving and maintaining the ideological realization of the beliefs in the Sharon Statement; and to maintain and operate a chapter-based organization with national, regional and local networks throughout the United States of America. YAF, the chapter affiliate of Young America's Foundation, yearns to spread conservatism on traditionally liberal college campuses.",
