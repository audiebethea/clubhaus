It is a great opportunity to develop real-world skills and network with professionals while making a positive and lasting difference at the University of Texas.\n\nIf you are a professional or academic who would like to speak at one of our meetings or participate in an upcoming panel, please email us!",

At the end of each semester, they have the opportunity to showcase their efforts in a public concert series. Members also have opportunities to promote music music by teaching kids about the science behind music and performing at nursing homes.\n\nFounded in the fall of 2009, EChO was immensely popular from its inception, with 70 new members grouped into small ensembles. In the spring of 2013, EChO started its first ever orchestra with only 13 string players. Now in its sixth year of existence, EChO boasts 157 members in 45 ensembles and one full orchestra with 38 performers.",

We perform the dance style of Bhangra, a high energy, fast paced dance form originating from the Punjab region in North India/Pakistan. Bhangra originated as a dance celebrating the harvest season each year in the villages and we strive to maintain the spirit in which Bhangra was performed. We accomplish these goals by performing at numerous charity and cultural events for both our campus and the community at large. Our team is known for our energy both on and off stage; we are driven to inspire others with our passion, dedication, and unique style.",

Since then, the\nmembership has changed dramatically but the mission and objectives of our organization\nremain the same. PhiDE (pronounced F-eye Dee Eee) provides educational opportunities,\nsupports philanthropic projects, and serves as a foundation for the development of relationships\namong medical professionals throughout the entire spectrum of a medical career.\nThrough a host of planned activities during the academic year, students develop their leadership\nand professional skills, which complement a basic understanding of medical science. When the\ntime comes to apply for medical school or match for residency, active membership in PhiDE is\nevidence of that a student is well rounded and motivated. In addition to our numerous resources\nfor the MCAT and USMLE, there are many chapter activities to help relieve the stress of\nstudying.\nSince 1904, when our professional coeducational organization was founded, we are\ncontinuously striving to meet the following objectives:\nÔÅ∂ To promote fellowship, equality, and unity.\nÔÅ∂ To promote the highest scientific and educational standards in the field of\nmedicine.\nÔÅ∂ To promote, uphold, and maintain the highest standards of ethics in the practice\nof medicine, medical teaching, and research.\nÔÅ∂ To promote non-profit service to the community.\nÔÅ∂ To promote discussions at all Fraternity level of current social and economic\nissues as related to medicine, the practice of medicine, and other health care\nrelated matters.",
