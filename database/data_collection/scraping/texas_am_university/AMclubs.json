    "fullDescription": "Our purpose is to serve Indian graduate students (those already on campus as well as the new incoming ones) and their families at Texas A&M University. We propose to be an organization in the service of over 800 Indian graduate students at Texas A&M University.\n\nOur student leaders have recognized that the issues faced by Indian graduate students and their needs are unique to this demographic. These graduate students come from a variety of backgrounds, and face many challenges with transitioning to a distinctly new system of rules and procedures. With a view to addressing these issues, our mission is based on the following key objectives:\n\n1) Advocacy\n\nMany Indian graduate students face serious challenges in coping with the challenges of the university requirements, and on many occasions, they are unaware of the resources available on campus to help resolve their issues. Consequently, there needs to be an organization that can lend a voice to this group of students, and also promote involvement at forums aimed towards university-level policy planning efforts. With these aims in mind, the IGA proposes to work with agencies like the OGS and GSC, among others, to facilitate their efforts with a focused group of the campus community.\n\n2) Networking\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop and maintain a strong networking resource that includes members from the current graduate school community, academia, industry professionals and the alumni. It is of utmost importance for the graduate students to be well-informed about the developments pertaining to their experiences at graduate school and beyond. Through events like socials, information sessions and others, IGSA plans to offer a platform for students to develop a strong network base that is both resourceful as well as engaging.\n\n3) Mentoring\n\nA serious lack of mentorship at a departmental level for our graduate students has been observed. Incoming Indian graduate students need guidance to step into the daily routines and workings of the department/courses/research. IGA plans to have departmental points-of-contact for all the major departments and schools on campus who can help the students based on their personal experiences and valuable resources in the form of other similar departmental representatives. The availability of such mentorship will help the students absorb core Aggie values, which, along with traditional Indian values, which will help the graduate students become healthy and successful Aggies.",

We offer scholarships and study guides which aid in academic achievement. Through philanthropy and other related activities, we hope to increase Asian Awareness and to assist communities in need.

Since 1949, Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. has expanded across the United States, holding multiple chapters in California and Texas. Our vision as a sorority is to promote sisterhood. We hold many sisterhood events throughout the year to promote such values as: unity, friendship and teamwork. Our mission is to help young women adjust to college life by creating a sisterhood that promotes Asian awareness. The sisters of Sigma Phi Omega are strongly committed to serving the community, as well. Our official National Philanthropy is domestic violence. In honor of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, our organization hosts a week of anti-domestic violence activities. However, this does not limit us to just one cause, our mission is much wider with a variety of other community service projects. Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc. intends to uphold it's foundation, while infusing it with the Aggie Spirit.",

We shoot 0.22 LR (5.6x15R mm) caliber target pistols and 0.177 (4.5mm) caliber compressed air pistols. Matches are hosted by Texas A&M once per semester and are attended by various other universities. The Team also travels each year to various matches hosted by competing universities, and each year the Team competes nationally in the Intercollegiate Nationals.",

The club is also a good place to get help in car projects and repairs as many of the club members have years of experience and valuable knowledge they'll gladly share.\n\nClub memberships give discounts at the club's events and discounts from the club's sponsors as well. Talk to the secretary for more details about memberships.\n\nDespite the name \"sports car club\" having a sports car is not necessary to partake in the club's events. Participants don't even have to have cars either. All that is needed is an interest in automobiles and a little sense of adventure.\n\nTAMSCC: \"Where driving is graded on a curve.\"",

The Coffee Club plans to work closely with nonprofits to raise funds in order to improve the lives that are essential in the industry, but not treated so. While there are a variety of competitions in the coffee industry, they are among professionals and if possible, we want to establish Texas A&M University in these competitions by training and sending members to compete. While there is not a formally established collegian coffee community, one is underway and we aim to pioneer it.

In addition to the infrastructure projects, Public Health Brigades also works with communities to provide health education to school-age children and adults in the community. The Public Health team collaborates with school teachers and other key community members to develop a curriculum that will directly address the communities‚Äô needs, while volunteers prepare lessons for the children during each brigade. We recruit students from all over campus with no particular prior experience needed. Each of the communities served receives a brigade every 3 to 4 months with hopes of creating self sustaining communities by preventing disease. Between brigades, the in-country team maintains relationships with the communities to provide follow-up to ensure all projects and education were successful.",

We then are not only able to voice for ourselves, build new connections, share scientific breakthroughs, but also discuss job information and exchange career advice. In addition, current leaders in the field are able to network and cooperate with each other, and at the same time pass down practical knowledge to the young generation.

As the popularity of animation has grown, it now reaches audiences of diverse age, gender, ethnicity, and culture. As this growth continues, so does the need to ensure that animation content represents the world as it should be - a world where women are equally represented, both behind the scenes and on the screen, to move culture forward. Women are known for the ability to value, tap into, and use our creativity and abilities to influence. And women's influence in animation is one that rounds out the industry, grows revenues, and contributes to that forward cultural momentum. Student chapters of WIA allow for programming and relationships that aids in demystifying the path from school to industry.",

We accomplish our mission by providing essential conferences, seminars, educational materials, internships, and speakers to young people across the country.\n\nIn 2011, Young America's Foundation unified with Young Americans for Freedom, which serves as the Foundation's chapter affiliate on college and high school campuses across the country. Founded by William F. Buckley, Jr. and a group of young conservatives in 1961 at his home in Sharon, Connecticut, Young Americans for Freedom today promotes to youth the principles of limited government, individual freedom, free enterprise, a strong national defense, and traditional values, as outlined in the Sharon Statement. The chapters accomplish this by participating in a wide range of campus initiatives, such as the 9/11: Never Forget Project, Freedom Week, and the GPA Redistribution Contest, among others; and by hosting prominent conservative speakers.",
