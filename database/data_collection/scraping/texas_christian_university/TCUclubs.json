The society expanded to the point that, in 1978, a committee was formed to petition for affiliation with the national organization AED. AED approved the petition, and on April 20, 1979, the Texas Zeta chapter of AED was established at TCU with the initiation of 31 active members, three active alumni, and five honorary members. Dr. Reinecke served as the faculty advisor until 1991 and was followed by Dr. Phil Hartman. Dr. Matt Chumchal succeeded Dr. Hartman in 2012 and served as the interim faculty advisor and officially taking the position in 2013. Dr. Chumchal currently resides as the chair of the TCU's Health Professions Committee and Dr. Reinecke and Dr. Hartman have also served as chairs. In addition, both Dr. Reinecke and Dr. Hartman have served as Regional Directors to the national organization. It may be of interest to know that there has been tremendous stability to TCU's Pre Health Professions Program. This is evidenced by the long tenure of each head of the program, noted as follows: Will Winton 1918-1950 Willis G. Hewatt 1950-1972 Manfred Reinecke 1972-1991 Phil Hartman 1992-2012 Matt Chumchal 2013-present -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The objectives of AED are to: * Encourage and recognize excellence in prehealth scholarship * Stimulate an appreciation for prehealth education * Promote cooperation and contacts between health professions students and premedical students and educators in developing an adequate program of prehealth education * Bind together similarly interested students * Use its knowledge for the benefit of health organizations, charities, and the community.",

The Grand Chapter has a membership of more than 350,000 predominantly African-American, college-educated women, and educated Caucasian, Asian, Native American, Hispanic, and African women. The sorority currently has 950-plus alumnae and collegiate chapters located in the United States, England, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Seoul, Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Haiti and Jamaica.[1] Delta Sigma Theta is a member of multiple organizations, including the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) — an organization of nine international Greek-letter sororities and fraternities - as well as the NAACP, and the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW).

Since founding in 1987, Omega Delta Phi has been an organization perpetually dedicated to the idea of constant growth and improvement. We must work to form an organization which not only challenges the traditional perception of fraternities, but also deals with the issues of culture and race in a completely new perspective. Omega Delta Phi is a multicultural service/social fraternity that aims at graduating its members while giving back to the community. The Fraternity has established itself on 50+ campuses and is predominantly centered in Texas and the Southwest. However, the Fraternity has been experiencing tremendous growth in the Midwest the last 10 years. Although founded primarily by Latinos, the Fraternity has traditionally always been open to men of different backgrounds, as demonstrated through its “One culture, any race” philosophy.",

The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift were adopted as cardinal principles.

    "fullDescription": "The Object of this Fraternity shall be for the development of the best and truest fraternal spirit; the mutual welfare and brotherhood of musical students; the advancement of music in America and a loyalty to the Alma Mater. Sinfonia was born on October 6, 1898 at the New England Conservatory in Boston, when a group of thirteen young men under the guidance of Ossian Everett Mills met “to consider the social life of the young men students of that institution” and “to devise ways and means by which it might be improved.” Mills, bursar of the Conservatory, sought to create an Order in which men with a shared love of music could develop the virtues of manhood in themselves and in their fellows. Sinfonia became a national fraternity on October 6, 1900, with the admission of a group of men at the Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia. Since that time Sinfonia has grown into the largest music fraternity in the world, with more than 150,000 initiates, and chapters on over 200 college and university campuses across the nation. For over a century, Sinfonians in nearly every field of study and professional endeavor have transformed the face of music in America. Today, the Brotherhood represents a diverse group of individuals spanning the nation, who continue the proud tradition of advancing the Fraternity’s Object. Sinfonia is a Brotherhood of men bound together for mutual helpfulness. Its purpose is not only to bring men together as friends, but also to provide a network of brothers with whom men can commune and renew their zeal — a support network that helps the individual to meet the challenges that face him in his daily life. By teaching men who are united as brothers to live their lives according to the noble virtues set forth in the Fraternity’s Initiation Ritual, Sinfonia builds better, stronger, broader individuals who are able to live in sympathy and in harmony with their Fraternity brothers and their fellow man. The Initiation Ritual of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, which will mark the transition into full membership, is one of the most meaningful and beautiful of the Greek tradition. The dedication to the advancement of universal Truths and brotherly association exemplified in the Ritual are the foundation of individual fraternal friendship, chapter unity, and national solidarity in the promotion of Sinfonia’s dual mission: the making of men and the uplift of mankind. Sinfonians share a love of music that unites them as brothers with a common interest. The Fraternity teaches men to develop themselves and their art, not for the sake of art itself, but as a means of enriching the lives of others. Through a multitude of chapter, provincial, and national events, Sinfonia offers unlimited opportunities for performance, community music outreach, and other activities designed to develop a true appreciation for the power of music to uplift the soul. Sinfonia’s collegiate chapters participate in a broad range of activities emphasizing brotherhood, service, and performance in music. Chapters take music into the community by singing at hospitals and homes for the elderly; sponsor concerts of American music, jazz and choral festivals, all-campus sings and Broadway-style reviews; provide a large variety of performing ensembles ranging from big bands to barbershop quartets; commission new works; bring prominent performers and clinicians to their campuses; and take part in a variety of other social and musical activities. The possibilities for participation in musical activities are limited only by the boundaries of imagination, desire, and commitment. Sinfonia provides many exciting opportunities for the development of social and leadership skills in an atmosphere of brotherhood and mutual support. Leadership roles may be assumed from nearly the first day an individual is pledged to become an active member of the Fraternity. Beyond the chapter, annual province workshops and national events allow members to become more involved and to develop meaningful friendships with other musical students across the nation.",

    "fullDescription": "The Eta Chi Chapter of Pi Kappa Phi was first conceived during the summer of 1996. Four men on the New Student Orientation Staff had developed a unique friendship while working together throughout the summer. First, they had developed a special bond – a brotherhood – that they did not want to end with the summer. Second, many incoming freshmen with strong leadership backgrounds in high school were being drawn into fraternities that did not nurture their potential. In their opinion, fraternities at TCU fell into one category: drinking clubs. They felt it was a shame that many men like themselves who wanted a fraternal experience that was more than a “drinking club,” did not have a viable option within the existing Greek system. They also believed the TCU fraternities had strayed away from the original purpose of fraternity – scholarship, leadership, service, and social experiences. They took the necessary steps for fraternity expansion at TCU and in March 1998 the first members were officially initiated into Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity at TCU. Today, we keep that vision alive by maintaining the same values that the chapter was founded upon",
