T he Iota Eta chapter serves the TCU community through various empowerment sessions, public service opportunities, and socials. Delta Sigma Theta (ΔΣΘ) is a non-profit Greek-lettered sorority of college-educated women who perform public service and place emphasis on the African American community. Delta Sigma Theta was founded on January 13, 1913, at Howard University by twenty-two illustrious women and now, over 100 years later, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. has become the largest African-American Greek-lettered sorority in the world. Membership in Delta Sigma Theta is open to any woman who meets the membership requirements, regardless of race, nationality, or religion. Women may join through undergraduate chapters at a college or university, or after acquiring a college degree through a graduate chapter. The Grand Chapter has a membership of more than 350,000 predominantly African-American, college-educated women, and educated Caucasian, Asian, Native American, Hispanic, and African women. The sorority currently has 950-plus alumnae and collegiate chapters located in the United States, England, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Seoul, Saint Thomas and Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Haiti and Jamaica.[1] Delta Sigma Theta is a member of multiple organizations, including the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) — an organization of nine international Greek-letter sororities and fraternities - as well as the NAACP, and the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW). The current national president is Cynthia M. A. Butler-McIntyre.",

Our brothers, nationwide, stay true to our mottos “En la union, esta la fuerza”/”In unity, there is strength” and “Chivalry Above Self,” and set the precedent of what it means to be fraternal men, gentlemen, and role models in the community.",

Love, Oscar J. Cooper and Frank Coleman. From the initials of the Greek phrase meaning \"friendship is essential to the soul,\" the name Omega Psi Phi was derived. The phrase was selected as the motto. Manhood, scholarship, perseverance and uplift were adopted as cardinal principles. A decision was made regarding the design for the pin and emblem, and thus ended the first meeting of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity.",
