Our philanthropy, Camp For All, is also focused on children with disabilities, and students are given many opportunities to volunteer and raise money for the organization. Members gain responsibility and understand how to better serve society through volunteering with our philanthropy and many other sponsored volunteering events. We will provide social events for our members to help them develop interpersonal skills and form stronger ties within the fraternity. Our organization will also offer opportunities for members to develop leadership skills. Professional events will also be provided, such as interview workshops, resume workshops and speakers in a variety of health care fields. Each member will have individual responsibilities, as they will be required to do an appropriate share of organizing and overseeing events. Furthermore, our organization will offer numerous officer positions so that devoted members can broaden their responsibility and leadership skills. We accept anyone with plans on going into a health care related field, such as public health, medical school, PT school, dental school, grad school and vet school.",

The mission of this organization is to provide a one-stop conglomerate of skydiving information and facilitation of the experience. The club's information and execution of activities is contributed by the top professionals and researchers in the sport.\n\nThis organization will uphold and support the five goals stated by the USPA (United States Parachute Association) for the National Collegiate Competition: learning, safety, competition, sportsmanship, and camaraderie.",

The coffee industry is complex and there are many opportunities to help improve the lives of farmers who do not have a voice to express their daily struggles or unfair compensation. The Coffee Club plans to work closely with nonprofits to raise funds in order to improve the lives that are essential in the industry, but not treated so. While there are a variety of competitions in the coffee industry, they are among professionals and if possible, we want to establish Texas A&M University in these competitions by training and sending members to compete. While there is not a formally established collegian coffee community, one is underway and we aim to pioneer it. As part of educating club members we plan to raise funds for scholarships so that students may study abroad and gain a hands on experience in every step of coffee production.",
